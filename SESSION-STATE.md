## Handoff Notes for Next Session

### Recommended Phase 1 Priorities
1. **00-Master-Index.md** — Create the central navigation hub; this is the backbone of the project
2. **Templates** — Standardize document formats before creating content
3. **Glossary.md** — Define key terms (Mansa, Oba, Mai, Negus, griot/djeli, etc.) to ensure consistency
4. **Bibliography expansion** — Add annotations and reliability assessments to existing sources

### Key Decisions Already Made
- Project follows the Persian Empire / Mongol Empire model (standalone academic database)
- Decolonizing framework is a core operating principle, not an afterthought
- Oral tradition is treated as legitimate primary source material with appropriate source criticism
- Confidence levels include `[Traditional/Oral]` category specific to this project
- Temporal scope is ~300-1600 CE (pre-Atlantic slave trade focus)
- Coverage is continental (West, East, Southern, Horn of Africa) not limited to a single region

### Known Challenges
- **Source imbalance:** West Africa has the richest written record (Arabic chronicles); Southern Africa relies heavily on archaeology; oral tradition coverage varies
- **Dating uncertainty:** Many events, especially before 1000 CE and outside the Horn of Africa, have approximate dates
- **Name standardization:** Multiple transliteration systems exist for most African names and places
- **Colonial-era distortions:** Some older scholarship contains racial biases (especially regarding Great Zimbabwe's builders); prefer post-1960s Africanist scholarship
- **Oral tradition methodology:** The project needs to develop consistent standards for using oral tradition as evidence

### Cross-Project Dependencies
- Islamic_Caliphates project: Trans-Saharan trade, Arabic source context
- Ancient_Egypt project: Nubian/Kushite background
- Crusades project: Prester John legend, Ethiopian contacts
- European_History project: Portuguese exploration context

### Key Decisions Log
| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-02-02 | Set temporal scope to ~300-1600 CE | Covers height of major kingdoms; avoids Atlantic slave trade era |
| 2026-02-02 | Adopted decolonizing framework | Essential for responsible treatment of African history |
| 2026-02-02 | Added [Traditional/Oral] confidence level | Necessary for region where oral tradition is primary evidence |
| 2026-02-02 | Organized by region within folders | African kingdoms are geographically diverse; regional organization more natural than chronological |
