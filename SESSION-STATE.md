## Project Completion Summary

### PROJECT COMPLETE — February 4, 2026

The Sub-Saharan African Kingdoms Academic Research Database is now complete after 10 working sessions.

**Final Statistics:**
- **166 markdown files** created
- **~1,083,000 words** of academic research content
- **All 11 phases** (0-10) completed
- **Decolonizing framework** applied throughout
- **Confidence levels** marked on all claims
- **Obsidian wiki-links** for full cross-referencing

### What This Database Contains

**Reference Materials:**
- Master Index, Bibliography, Glossary, Chronological Framework, Archaeological Sites Index
- 4 document templates (Character, Battle, Location, Primary Source)

**Timelines (9 files):**
- Master timeline + 4 regional + 3 thematic + index

**Prosopography (49 files):**
- 48 biographical profiles + index covering rulers, scholars, warriors, queens

**Battles & Campaigns (29 files):**
- 28 military analyses + index covering ~300-1600 CE

**Geography (19 files):**
- 14 cities, 2 trade routes, 1 ecological zone, 1 index + navigation

**Religion (9 files):**
- Indigenous religions, Islam, Christianity across all regions

**Society & Economy (10 files):**
- Trade networks, social structures, slavery, gender, currency

**Culture & Arts (11 files):**
- Oral literature, visual arts, architecture, music, material culture

**Primary Sources (11 files):**
- Arabic chronicles, Ethiopian sources, oral tradition methodology

**Fiction Resources (8 files):**
- Scene seeds, character archetypes, sensory guides for fiction writers

### Key Decisions Already Made
- Project follows the Persian Empire / Mongol Empire model (standalone academic database)
- Decolonizing framework is a core operating principle, not an afterthought
- Oral tradition is treated as legitimate primary source material with appropriate source criticism
- Confidence levels include `[Traditional/Oral]` category specific to this project
- Temporal scope is ~300-1600 CE (pre-Atlantic slave trade focus)
- Coverage is continental (West, East, Southern, Horn of Africa) not limited to a single region

### Known Challenges
- **Source imbalance:** West Africa has the richest written record (Arabic chronicles); Southern Africa relies heavily on archaeology; oral tradition coverage varies
- **Dating uncertainty:** Many events, especially before 1000 CE and outside the Horn of Africa, have approximate dates
- **Name standardization:** Multiple transliteration systems exist for most African names and places
- **Colonial-era distortions:** Some older scholarship contains racial biases (especially regarding Great Zimbabwe's builders); prefer post-1960s Africanist scholarship
- **Oral tradition methodology:** The project needs to develop consistent standards for using oral tradition as evidence

### Cross-Project Dependencies
- Islamic_Caliphates project: Trans-Saharan trade, Arabic source context
- Ancient_Egypt project: Nubian/Kushite background
- Crusades project: Prester John legend, Ethiopian contacts
- European_History project: Portuguese exploration context
