## Overview

The trans-Saharan caravan journey was one of the great human endeavors of medieval history — a two-month odyssey across the most hostile desert on Earth, undertaken for profit, faith, and survival. For fiction writers, the caravan journey offers an extraordinary setting: a closed society of merchants, guides, slaves, and adventurers thrown together in circumstances that strip away social pretense and reveal character under pressure.

This document provides scene seeds for the major stages of the caravan journey, from departure in a Sahel city through desert crossing to arrival in North Africa. Each section offers sensory details, dramatic possibilities, and character opportunities grounded in primary source accounts. The goal is to help writers evoke an authentic, vivid world.

**A note on sources:** The most valuable primary account is Ibn Battuta's *Rihla*, in which the Moroccan traveler describes his 1352 journey from Sijilmasa through Taghaza to Walata and the Mali heartland. Leo Africanus (c. 1510-1512 visits, written 1526) provides additional detail on Timbuktu and the Songhai period. Al-Bakri (1068) and al-Umari (c. 1337-1349) offer earlier perspectives. All these sources have their biases — they are written by educated Muslim men, often foreigners or visitors, with particular perspectives on what was noteworthy — but they provide the texture that makes the caravan journey come alive.

## Scene Seed 1: Departure from a Sahel City

### Setting: Timbuktu, Walata, or Gao

The departure of a trans-Saharan caravan was a major event for both the departing travelers and the city left behind. Caravans typically departed in the cooler months (October-March) to avoid the worst Saharan heat, and the preparations began days or weeks before the actual departure.

### The Assembly Point

**Location:** Outside the city walls or at a designated staging ground, often near a major market or caravanserai.

**Time:** Pre-dawn, when the air is still cool. The first light of day reveals the organized chaos of hundreds of camels, merchants, and laborers preparing for the journey.

**The Scene:**
Camels — hundreds of them, perhaps a thousand — kneel in rough lines across the sandy ground, their groaning complaints filling the pre-dawn darkness. The smell is overwhelming: camel dung, camel sweat, the oily lanolin of their coats, mixed with the smoke of cooking fires where final meals are being prepared. Torches and oil lamps create pools of yellow light in the blue darkness, illuminating men moving between the animals with practiced urgency.

The loading is a precise art. Each camel can carry approximately 200-300 pounds, divided into two loads that must balance precisely across the animal's hump. Salt blocks from Taghaza — cut to standard sizes, heavy and sharp-edged — are wrapped in matting and secured with ropes. Textiles from the south, bundled tight. Leather bags of gold dust, small but precious, distributed among trusted camels and trusted men. The most valuable goods are hidden among less conspicuous cargo.

**Character Opportunities:**

*The Merchant Lord:* A wealthy trader making his tenth or twentieth crossing. He moves through the chaos with proprietary calm, checking his goods, conferring with his agents, accepting the greetings of lesser merchants who hope to travel under his protection. His robes are fine, his beard perfumed, but his eyes are calculating — every crossing is a risk, and the desert shows no favoritism to wealth.

*The First-Timer:* A young man making his first crossing, perhaps the son of a merchant being initiated into the family trade, or an aspiring scholar traveling to study in the north. Everything is new and terrifying. The size of the caravan, the organized chaos, the knowledge that ahead lies weeks of waterless desert — his hands shake slightly as he checks his small bundle of possessions.

*The Slave Being Transported:* Among the cargo are human beings — enslaved people being taken northward for sale in the Maghreb. They are roped together in small groups, watched by guards. Their faces show the range of human response to horror: blank numbness, wild-eyed fear, resigned exhaustion. One might still be calculating escape; another has accepted that there is no escape and is simply trying to survive the journey.

*The Guide:* A Tuareg or Berber desert specialist who knows the routes as other men know the streets of their hometown. He moves through the crowd with quiet authority, checking supplies, conferring with the caravan master. His face is veiled in the characteristic Tuareg fashion; his eyes, visible above the veil, are the only part of him that communicates — and they communicate confidence. Without him, the entire enterprise would be suicide.

### The Farewells

**The Scene:**
As the eastern sky begins to lighten, families appear at the staging ground. Wives who have said their formal goodbyes at home come for a final glimpse. Children run between the camels, excited by the spectacle, until mothers grab them back. The air fills with the murmur of prayers, last-minute instructions, and the kind of charged silence that precedes long partings.

The departing merchant embraces his brother, his father, his sons too young to travel. He gives instructions about business, about the household, about the family he is leaving for months. The women watch from the edges, veiled, their farewells already given in private.

An imam leads prayers for the caravan's safe passage. The words rise in the pre-dawn air: *Bismillah al-Rahman al-Rahim* — In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Travelers kneel toward Mecca, touching foreheads to the ground that will soon be hundreds of miles behind them.

**Sensory Details:**
- The sound of hundreds of camels groaning, spitting, complaining
- The smell of animal and cooking fire and the dust raised by so many feet
- The first warmth of the rising sun after the chill of the desert night
- The texture of rope in the hands, rough and reassuring
- The taste of the last drink of clean water, savored knowing what lies ahead

### The Caravan Master's Authority

The caravan master (*khabar* or *ra'is*) held absolute authority once the journey began. His word was law, his decisions unquestionable. Lives depended on his experience, his judgment, his nerve.

**The Scene:**
The caravan master — a lean, weathered man whose face tells stories the desert has written — mounts his camel and rides to the head of the column. He raises a hand, and the noise dies down. In a voice that carries, he gives the command. The lead camels rise — first the back legs, lurching the riders forward, then the front legs, settling into the distinctive swaying stance. Down the line, camel after camel rises, a wave of motion extending back through the column.

The first steps. The caravan begins to move, slowly at first, then finding its rhythm. The city recedes behind them. Ahead: the open plain, and beyond it, the desert.

**Dramatic Tension:**
- A late arrival running to join, shouting for the caravan to wait — will the master delay, or leave him behind?
- A dispute over positioning — who travels near the front (safer, less dust) versus the rear (more exposed, eating the caravan's dust)?
- A merchant discovering at the last moment that his goods were improperly loaded — but the caravan cannot wait

---

## Scene Seed 2: The Desert Crossing

### The Rhythm of Travel

Trans-Saharan caravans developed a rhythm dictated by the desert's extremes. During the hottest months, travel was primarily at night; during cooler periods, travel continued during daylight with midday rest. The typical pace was 20-30 miles per day, with the entire crossing taking 40-70 days depending on route and conditions.

### Night Travel

**The Scene:**
The caravan moves under a sky that holds more stars than any city-dweller can imagine. The Milky Way is a river of light overhead, so bright it casts faint shadows. The moon, when present, transforms the landscape into a world of silver and black. When absent, the darkness is profound, and the caravan navigates by star patterns that the guides have known since childhood.

The sounds at night are reduced to the essential: the padding of camel feet on sand and gravel, the creak of saddles, the soft conversation of men who have been awake for hours. Occasionally, a guide calls out a landmark — a particular rock formation visible against the stars, a subtle change in the terrain's slope that indicates they are on course.

The cold is a surprise to those making their first crossing. The desert's daytime furnace becomes a refrigerator at night; men wrap themselves in every piece of cloth they own and still shiver. The camels, evolved for this, plod on indifferently.

**Sensory Details:**
- The crunch of gravel beneath camel feet, audible in the night silence
- The smell of cold dust, metallic and dry
- The weight of a wool robe pulled tight against the chill
- The taste of one's own chapped lips, cracked from the dry air
- The stars — patterns unknown to Europeans, guiding points for those who know them

### Daytime Rest

**The Scene:**
As the sun rises, its warmth is first welcome, then oppressive, then punishing. By mid-morning, the caravan has stopped, finding what shade exists — often just the shadow of their own camels and the tents they carry. Men lie motionless under stretched cloth, conserving energy and moisture.

The heat is physical, pressing down like a weight. The air shimmers; the horizon melts and reforms. Mirages appear — tantalizing lakes that exist only in the heated air, disappearing as one approaches. Men who know the desert ignore them; newcomers must be restrained from chasing hallucinations.

No one moves who does not have to. Water is rationed — a careful amount per person per day, tracked by the guides who know exactly how far it is to the next well. The temptation to drink more is constant; the discipline to resist is survival.

### The Terrible Heat

Ibn Battuta describes the Saharan heat in terms that still resonate:

**The Scene:**
By early afternoon, the heat has become something beyond temperature — a presence, a pressure, an enemy. The sand is hot enough to burn exposed skin. Metal objects — a knife, a belt buckle — become impossible to touch. Men lie in whatever shade exists, breathing shallow, lips cracked, waiting for the sun to descend.

The merchants from the Sahel, accustomed to heat, endure. The merchants from the north, used to Mediterranean climates, suffer. A man from Fez, making his first crossing, lies with a wet cloth over his face (wet with precious water, an extravagance), praying for the sun to move faster.

The camels wait with prehistoric patience. They are evolved for this: their humps store not water but fat, which they metabolize without requiring additional water. Their nostrils can close against blowing sand. Their wide feet spread weight across the yielding surface. The caravan depends on animals that have spent millions of years becoming perfect for this environment.

**Dramatic Possibilities:**
- Heat prostration: a traveler collapses, fevered and confused. Will the caravan wait for him to recover, or leave him?
- A fight over water: accusations that someone drank more than their ration. The caravan master must judge — and the desert does not permit second chances
- The breakdown of a weaker traveler: weeping, begging to turn back, having to be physically restrained from drinking his full water supply at once

### Navigation by Stars and Landmarks

**The Scene:**
The head guide rides apart from the caravan, scanning the darkness ahead. He has made this crossing a dozen times; his father made it before him, and his father before that. The route is written in his memory as a sequence of signs: a V-shaped rock formation visible at dawn, a particular color of sand indicating an underground watercourse, the angle at which certain stars intersect with the horizon.

He raises a hand, adjusts the caravan's direction slightly leftward. No one questions him. To question him would be to question whether the sun rises in the east.

When the landmarks fail — when a sandstorm has rearranged the dunes, when clouds obscure the stars — the guide must rely on subtler signs: the prevailing wind direction, the slope of the terrain, the behavior of animals that sense water from great distances. Experienced guides navigate not by a single method but by the integration of dozens of inputs, processed by experience into something that looks like instinct.

**Sensory Details:**
- The smell of a guide's campfire, different from the others — he burns particular plants whose smoke he reads for moisture content in the air
- The sound of the guide's voice, calling instructions in Tamasheq or Berber, translated by assistants for those who do not understand
- The texture of particular sand: fine and shifting (dangerous, tiring), coarse and stable (easier passage), mixed with gravel (the best for travel)

### Water Management

**The Scene:**
Each morning and evening, water is distributed. The caravan master and the guide supervise, measuring out portions with practiced precision. Goatskin bags (*guerba*) are passed from hand to hand; each man drinks his ration, no more, while witnesses watch.

The water has its own taste — the leather of the bags, the mineral tang of whatever well last filled them, sometimes a faint greenish flavor that suggests algae and the desperate hope that it will not cause sickness. Men drink slowly, holding each mouthful, letting parched tissues absorb before swallowing.

The camels drink differently — a camel can consume 30 gallons in ten minutes when water is available, storing it in their tissues for days or weeks of travel. At an oasis, the camels drink first; their survival ensures everyone's survival.

**Dramatic Possibilities:**
- A water bag found leaking: hours of water lost to the sand, and the nearest oasis is days away
- The discovery that a well marked on the route is dry or poisoned
- Accusations of water theft — a capital offense, to be judged by the caravan master with summary authority

### Sandstorms

**The Scene:**
The storm appears on the horizon as a brown-yellow wall, rising from the desert floor to the sky. The guides shout warnings, and the caravan halts with desperate speed. Men hobble camels, unload what they can, huddle in the lee of their animals.

Then the storm hits.

The world becomes sand. It enters everything: eyes, nose, mouth, ears. It penetrates the folds of robes, the seams of bags, the gaps in tents. The sound is a roar, a hissing, a pressure on the ears. Visibility drops to arm's length; a man who wanders three steps from his camel may never find it again.

Hours pass. Some storms last for a day, two days. Men lie face-down, cloth wrapped over their faces, breathing through fabric that filters the worst of the sand but cannot keep it all out. Grit in the teeth, grit in the lungs. The taste of the desert filling one's body.

When the storm passes, the world has changed. Familiar landmarks are buried or rearranged. The guide emerges, studies the altered landscape, recalculates. The caravan may have lost a day, or two. They may have lost men — those who were separated in the blinding chaos, who wandered in the wrong direction, whose bodies will become landmarks themselves, warnings to future travelers.

**Sensory Details:**
- The roar of the wind, louder than conversation
- The taste of sand, gritty and mineral, unavoidable
- The claustrophobia of having one's head wrapped in cloth, breathing through layers of fabric
- The silence when the storm ends — sudden, profound, disorienting
- The new landscape revealed: dunes shifted, rocks exposed, the route uncertain

### Deaths on the Route

The trans-Saharan crossing killed people regularly. Al-Bakri describes how travelers followed the smell of rotting bodies to navigate — the dead marking the path for the living.

**The Scene:**
The caravan passes a cluster of bones, bleached white by sun, scattered by scavengers. A human skull, half-buried in sand. Nearby, the larger bones of camels. No one stops; there is nothing to do. A man murmurs a prayer for the unknown dead. Another calculates: how many days from here did they die? What went wrong?

Later, a man in the caravan falls ill. He has been weakening for days — not enough water, too much heat, perhaps age or underlying illness finally claiming him in the desert's unforgiving environment. By nightfall, he cannot ride. By dawn, he cannot stand.

The caravan master faces the decision that trans-Saharan caravans have faced for centuries. The caravan cannot wait; every day of delay consumes water that may be the difference between survival and death for everyone. Can the man ride, supported by others? Can he be carried? At what cost to the camels, to the water supply, to the schedule?

The Islamic duty to the dead is clear. The practical calculus of the desert is equally clear. The caravan master prays, consults, decides.

**Dramatic Possibilities:**
- A merchant insists on waiting for his ill companion — against the caravan master's orders. Will others support him, or will he be overruled?
- A slave falls ill. The question of whether to wait carries different weight when the dying person is property.
- A man recovers at the last moment — or appears to. Is he strong enough to continue, or will his apparent recovery only mean a slower death?

## Scene Seed 3: The Oasis Stop

### Arriving at Water

The oasis was salvation, resurrection, paradise found. After days of rationed water and waterless horizons, the sight of palm trees — first as a smudge on the horizon, then as undeniable vertical lines against the flat landscape — produced emotions that travelers struggled to describe.

**The Scene:**
The guide points ahead, and a murmur runs through the caravan. Men stand in their saddles, shading their eyes, trying to confirm what the guide has indicated. Is it real, or another mirage? The mirages have tormented them for days — shimmering lakes that dissolve on approach, phantom trees that exist only in heated air.

But the palm trees do not dissolve. They grow more distinct as the caravan approaches: date palms, their fronds moving slightly in a breeze too faint to feel. And beneath them, the gleam of water.

The camels smell it before the men can see it clearly. Their pace quickens without being urged; they strain against their halters, groaning with what sounds like anticipation. The orderly column begins to fragment as animals push forward.

The caravan master shouts for order. There are protocols for arrival — the animals must be managed, the water must be shared with whatever settlement exists at the oasis, disputes must not be allowed to poison relations with people the caravan will need for the return journey. But the men are half-mad with relief, and the camels are beyond anyone's control.

**Sensory Details:**
- The first smell of water — muddy, green, bacterial, and more beautiful than any perfume
- The sound of the oasis: birds, rustling palms, voices of the inhabitants
- The color green, shockingly vivid after days of brown and gold and the blue-white of the sky
- The taste of fresh water — warm, tasting of the earth, but fresh, not stored in leather for days
- The feel of mud between toes, of cool shade after endless sun

### The Settlement

Most Saharan oases supported small permanent populations who extracted tolls from passing caravans and provided essential services: water, dates, fodder for animals, sometimes repairs to equipment and care for the ill.

**The Scene:**
The oasis of Taghaza — or Tuat, or one of the scattered watering points along the route — is not beautiful by any standard of the settled world. The houses are rough, built of whatever materials are available (at Taghaza, Ibn Battuta reports, even the houses are made of salt blocks). The population is small, impoverished, eking out existence at the edge of the habitable world.

But to the caravan, it is paradise.

The inhabitants emerge to meet the caravan, assessing its size, its composition, its potential for profit. The headman of the oasis approaches the caravan master; negotiations begin immediately. How many days will they stay? What payment for water, for fodder, for camping space? Are there slaves available for purchase or sale? Does the caravan carry news from the south, from the north?

**Character Opportunities:**

*The Oasis Headman:* A man who has spent his entire life in this marginal place, who has seen a hundred caravans pass through. He knows his leverage: the caravan needs him more than he needs any single caravan. But he also knows that excessive extraction will divert future caravans to other routes. His negotiation is an art form, calibrated to extract maximum value without killing the goose that lays golden eggs.

*The Oasis Worker:* Probably enslaved, or nearly so — the salt miners of Taghaza were famously enslaved, working in brutal conditions that killed them within a few years. He watches the caravan with the blank face that survival requires. The merchants from the south, some of whom might be his countrymen, do not meet his eyes. He is part of the commerce, not a party to it.

*The Caravan's Physician:* A learned man who has made the crossing to treat illnesses among the travelers. At the oasis, he is suddenly in demand: the local inhabitants bring their sick to him, hoping for cures their own limited medicine cannot provide. He must balance his obligations to the caravan (which is paying him) against his obligations as a healer.

### Resupply and Rest

**The Scene:**
The caravan settles into the oasis for two days, perhaps three. The camels drink and drink, then graze on whatever vegetation exists. Men bathe in the oasis pool — warm, brackish water that is nevertheless luxury itself after weeks without washing.

The merchants inspect their goods. The rough handling of the crossing has damaged some cargo: a bale of cloth has been torn; a bag of gold dust may have leaked (or been pilfered). Disputes arise over the condition of goods being transported for others; the caravan master adjudicates.

At Taghaza, the caravan loads salt. The great slabs, cut from the salt pans that surround the oasis, are heavy and awkward. Enslaved workers haul them from the mines to the caravan's loading area. Each slab must be balanced against its counterpart on the other side of the camel; if the loads are uneven, the animal will develop sores, will weaken, may die before the southern journey is complete.

**Sensory Details:**
- The taste of dates, sweet and sticky, a luxury after days of dried provisions
- The sound of laughter — the tension of the crossing releasing in the safety of water
- The smell of cooking fires, of food more elaborate than anything possible during the crossing
- The sight of the stars, still brilliant but now framed by palm fronds
- The feel of clean(er) skin, of rested limbs, of security however temporary

### News Exchange

**The Scene:**
The oasis is a node in the information network that spans the Sahara. News from the south meets news from the north; rumors, prices, political developments flow through the resting caravans like water through the irrigation channels.

The merchants gather in the evening to exchange information. The questions are practical: What is the price of gold in Sijilmasa this season? Who rules in the Maghreb now — has the dynastic struggle been resolved? What is the condition of the northern roads? Are there bandits on the routes? Is there plague anywhere?

And questions from the north, asked of those who have traveled south: What is the price of salt in Timbuktu? What goods are in demand? Who rules in Mali, in Songhai? Are the scholars still teaching, the markets still open, the roads still safe?

The information is valuable, and it is traded as carefully as any other commodity. A merchant who shares too freely may give advantage to competitors; one who hoards may find information withheld from him in turn.

**Dramatic Possibilities:**
- A rumor of war in the north: should the caravan continue, or wait for more information?
- News of a death in a merchant's family: how can word be sent? Should he abandon the crossing and return?
- Information about a competitor's cargo: the opportunity for strategic advantage, or the beginning of conflict

## Scene Seed 4: The Salt Mines

### Taghaza and Taoudenni

The salt mines of the central Sahara were among the most valuable and most brutal enterprises of the medieval world. Taghaza (replaced by Taoudenni in later centuries) produced the rock salt that was literally worth its weight in gold in the forest zone of West Africa.

### The Brutal Conditions

Ibn Battuta visited Taghaza in 1352 and described it as "an unattractive village with nothing good about it." His account, though brief, captures the essential horror:

**The Scene:**
The settlement has no natural water — all water must be brought from wells a day's journey distant, carried in on camels, and sold at prices that make the water nearly as precious as the salt. The buildings are constructed of salt blocks, the roofs of camel hides; the wind blows through, carrying salt dust that coats everything and everyone.

The workers in the mines are enslaved. They have been brought here by force, and they will die here. The work is brutal: cutting salt from the deposits with primitive tools, hauling the blocks to the surface, cutting them to the standard sizes that the caravans require. The salt dust enters their lungs, their eyes, their wounds; it kills them within a few years, sometimes within months. New slaves are brought to replace them, an endless supply from the wars of the Sahel and forest zone.

The miners work in tunnels and open pits, depending on the local geology. The salt glitters in the lamplight, beautiful and deadly. The men who cut it are gaunt, salt-rimed, coughing. They do not speak to the merchants; the merchants do not speak to them. The transaction is simple: the merchants pay the oasis masters, take the salt, and leave. What happens to the men who cut the salt is not their concern.

**Sensory Details:**
- The taste of salt, everywhere — on the lips, in the food, in the very air
- The smell of unwashed bodies, of animal dung used for fuel (there is nothing else to burn)
- The sound of hammering and cutting, the clink of tools on crystalline rock
- The texture of salt blocks: rough, heavy, slightly damp with mineral moisture
- The sight of the miners: emaciated, covered in salt dust, moving with the slow deliberation of the exhausted

### Slave Labor

**The Scene:**
The new cargo is lined up at the edge of the salt works: twenty men, newly arrived from the south on the previous caravan. They were captured in a war between Songhai and one of its tributary states, sold to merchants at the Gao market, marched across the desert to this place. They will not leave.

The overseer inspects them with professional detachment. He knows the life expectancy here; he calculates how many of them will survive long enough to be useful. The strong ones will go to the cutting face. The weaker ones will haul the blocks. The weakest will be dead within a month.

One of the new arrivals — young, strong, still carrying some of the dignity he had as a free man — meets the overseer's eye. The overseer strikes him with a stick, not hard, but with the casual authority of one who has beaten men before. The young man drops his eyes. He has begun to learn.

**Character Opportunities:**

*The Moral Merchant:* A trader who has made this journey for years, who knows what happens at Taghaza, and who has learned not to see it. His religion tells him that enslaving fellow Muslims is forbidden, but these are captives from wars against non-believers, and the legal fictions are comfortable. Tonight, in his tent, he will pray for forgiveness without knowing what he is asking forgiveness for.

*The Slave Who Has Survived:* A man who has been in the mines for two years, which is a kind of record. He has survived by becoming essential: he knows the best cutting techniques, the places where the salt is purest, the tricks that keep a man alive a little longer. He has also learned to inform on his fellow slaves, to curry favor with the overseers, to do what survival requires. He is alive, and he will not think about the price.

*The Caravan's Chronicler:* A scholar traveling with the caravan, documenting the journey. He sees the salt works, the slaves, the conditions. He writes it down — Ibn Battuta did — but he writes it as observation, not as condemnation. The slaves are part of the landscape, part of the trade, part of the way the world works.

### Loading the Salt

**The Scene:**
The caravan takes on salt, the commodity that justifies the entire journey. The standard block weighs approximately 200 pounds, though sizes vary. Each camel will carry two blocks, balanced carefully on either side of the hump.

The loading is supervised by experienced handlers who know that an improperly balanced load will cripple a camel before the journey ends. The salt is wrapped in matting to protect it from moisture (there is precious little moisture to worry about in the central Sahara, but the matting also protects the salt from crumbling) and secured with rope.

The merchants calculate: how many blocks, at what price here, to sell at what price in Timbuktu? The profit margins are enormous — salt that costs almost nothing in the mines (the real cost is the slaves who die to produce it) will sell for many times its weight in gold in the forest zone. But the risks are also enormous: the desert crossing, the possibility of loss, the need to pay guides and guards and tolls along the way.

**Sensory Details:**
- The grunt of camels as the salt blocks are heaved onto their backs
- The call of the handlers, coordinating the lift: "Ready — lift — place"
- The smell of camel and salt and rope and the particular chemical sharpness of crystalline rock
- The weight of a salt block, felt briefly in the hands before it is transferred to the camel
- The crunch of salt underfoot, fragments that have broken from the blocks

### The Economics of Salt

**The Scene:**
Two merchants argue over the price of salt blocks. The seller, representing the oasis masters, wants more; the buyer, representing the caravan's investors, offers less. The negotiation is ritual as much as commerce: both parties know approximately what the blocks will sell for in the south, and both parties have a sense of the acceptable range.

But within that range, there is room for maneuvering. The buyer points out that some blocks are cracked, that the quality is not what it was last year, that he has other sources for salt. The seller points out that the buyer's camels are already loaded, that he cannot go elsewhere now, that to return to the north without salt is to return with nothing.

The negotiation continues, interrupted by prayers, by refreshments, by the elaborate courtesies that structure commercial relationships. Eventually, a price is agreed. Hands are shaken, witnesses invoked, God's name called upon to sanctify the agreement.

**Dramatic Possibilities:**
- A block is found to be inferior quality after loading — the caravan has already departed. What recourse does the buyer have?
- A dispute over weights: the seller's scale differs from the buyer's. Who adjudicates?
- A new source of salt is rumored to have opened on a different route. The economics of the entire trade may be shifting.

## Scene Seed 5: Arrival in the North

### First Sight of Sijilmasa or Marrakesh

The arrival at the northern terminus reversed all the emotions of departure. The desert was behind; civilization lay ahead. But the transition was not without its own tensions.

**The Scene:**
The walls of Sijilmasa appear on the horizon, and the caravan stirs with anticipation. The guides relax visibly; they have done their job, delivered their charges, and their authority is about to shift to the city's officials.

The approach is slow — the caravan is exhausted, the camels gaunt after weeks of travel. But the camels smell the water of the oasis, the fodder awaiting them, and they quicken their pace without urging.

The gates of the city are open, but they are guarded. The caravan does not simply enter; it is received, assessed, taxed. Officials of the city appear to meet the caravan master, to inquire about cargo, to begin the process of customs assessment that will determine how much of the caravan's profit will flow to the city's rulers.

**Sensory Details:**
- The sight of buildings, permanent stone and mud-brick buildings, rising in the distance
- The sound of a city: voices, hammering, animals, music — the sound of life at scale
- The smell of water, of cooking, of humanity concentrated — after weeks of desert, overwhelming
- The taste of anticipation, of arrival, of the first real meal to come
- The feel of exhaustion mixed with relief, the knowledge that the hardest part is over

### Customs and Inspection

**The Scene:**
The caravan is directed to a staging area outside the city gates. Here, the officials conduct their assessments. Each merchant must declare his cargo; each declaration is weighed against what the officials can see and what informants may have told them.

The process is corrupt — everyone knows it is corrupt, and everyone has factored the corruption into their calculations. A bribe to the chief inspector reduces the assessed value of the cargo; a gift to his assistant ensures that certain bags are not opened. The negotiations are as delicate as anything that happened in the desert, and the stakes may be just as high.

A merchant who underdeclares his cargo risks confiscation. A merchant who overdeclares pays taxes he did not need to pay. The successful merchant finds the middle ground, the accommodation that satisfies the officials without impoverishing the merchant.

**Character Opportunities:**

*The Corrupt Inspector:* He has held this position for years, becoming rich in the process. He knows exactly how much each merchant can afford to pay, and he extracts precisely that amount. His manner is unctuous, his threats veiled in courtesy. He is hated, and he knows it, and he does not care.

*The Honest Merchant:* A rarity — a merchant who refuses to pay bribes on principle. His declarations are accurate, his taxes are high, and his competitors think him a fool. But he has a reputation for integrity that opens certain doors that bribery cannot.

*The Slave Merchant:* His cargo is human, and the inspection is different. The enslaved people are lined up, assessed for health and strength, valued for the tax rolls. The merchant hopes the inspector does not notice the illness that has been spreading through his cargo since the desert crossing.

### Selling the Cargo

**The Scene:**
The caravan disperses into the city's markets. Each merchant seeks out the buyers he has been trading with for years, or new buyers offering better prices, or agents who will handle the sales on commission.

The gold dust is the most valuable cargo. It is weighed on precise scales, assessed for purity, converted into coin or goods or credit. The negotiations are lengthy, elaborate, structured by Islamic commercial law and by custom.

Salt — what remains of the salt loaded at Taghaza — is sold into the local market or stored for future sale. Here in the north, salt is not the precious commodity it is in the south; the profit is made in the south, not here. But there is still demand, still a market, still commerce to be done.

Textiles, leather goods, the products of the Sahelian workshops: these find buyers too, though the Maghrebi buyers are discriminating, accustomed to the finest products of Europe and the East.

And the enslaved people are sold. The slave market of Sijilmasa is smaller than some, larger than others. Buyers assess the merchandise with professional detachment: this one is strong, that one is sick, this one might be trained for a skilled position, that one is suited only for labor. The enslaved people stand in silence, waiting to learn their fates.

**Sensory Details:**
- The glitter of gold dust on the weighing scales
- The sound of the marketplace: bargaining voices in Arabic, Berber, dozens of languages
- The smell of spices, of cooking, of the packed humanity of a prosperous city
- The taste of foods not eaten in months: fresh bread, grilled meat, fruit
- The feel of coin in the hand, the solid weight of profit realized

### Preparing for Return

**The Scene:**
The caravan's work is not finished. The return journey must be organized: goods purchased in the north to be sold in the south, arrangements made for guides and guards and supplies, negotiations reopened with all the parties who facilitated the outward journey.

Some merchants will return with the same caravan. Others will stay in the north for months or years, tending their business, before joining a future caravan heading south. A few have completed their last crossing — their age, their health, or their accumulated wealth allowing them to retire from the desert trade.

The caravan master reviews the losses from the crossing: how many camels died, how many men were lost, how much water was consumed, how many days the journey required. He notes what went well and what went poorly, information that will shape the next crossing.

And already, in the markets and caravanserais of Sijilmasa, the next caravan is being assembled. The trade continues.

## Scene Seed 6: Extended Sensory Details

### The Desert Silence

**The Scene:**
On the third day out from the oasis, the silence becomes absolute. There are no birds, no insects, no wind rustling vegetation — there is no vegetation to rustle. The only sounds are those the caravan itself makes: the pad of camel feet, the creak of leather, the murmur of human voices, the occasional command of a guide.

And when the caravan stops — when the men rest and the camels stand motionless — even those sounds cease. The silence is not merely the absence of sound; it is a presence, a weight, a texture. It fills the ears like water, like sand. Men who have not experienced it become disoriented, uncomfortable, almost frightened. Those who know it describe it as both terrifying and peaceful, a communion with something larger than human concerns.

At night, the silence is broken by sounds that carry for miles: a cough, a camel's groan, the call of a guide checking his position. Every sound is distinct, separated from every other sound by depths of quietude.

### The Wind

**The Scene:**
The wind begins as a whisper, barely perceptible. Then it builds: a steady pressure from the northeast, the harmattan carrying dust from the deep Sahara. It is not yet a sandstorm, but it is the wind that precedes sandstorms, and the guides watch it with careful attention.

The wind reshapes everything. Sand collects in the folds of robes, in the creases of faces, in the corners of eyes. It hisses against the camels' sides like a living thing. It strips moisture from exposed skin, leaving lips cracked and hands raw.

The wind sounds like nothing else: a white noise that is also a voice, speaking in languages no human speaks, carrying messages from the empty heart of the continent. Men who travel the Sahara learn to read the wind — its direction, its intensity, its moisture content, its meaning. They know which winds bring safety and which bring death.

### Camel Sounds and Smells

**The Scene:**
The camels complain constantly. Their groans, bellows, and garglings form a continuous background noise that new travelers find maddening and experienced ones cease to notice. A camel being loaded protests at each addition of weight. A camel being mounted screams as if being murdered. A camel walking carries on a running commentary of grunts and sighs.

The smell of camel is equally pervasive: a powerful, oily, animal smell that penetrates everything. It is not unpleasant once one is accustomed to it — some travelers describe it as almost comforting, associated as it becomes with survival. But it is inescapable, following the traveler even into sleep.

The relationship between camel and rider evolves over a long crossing. The camel is not a horse — it does not bond with its rider, does not respond to affection, does not care whether its rider lives or dies. But it is supremely adapted to its environment, and a rider who learns to work with the camel's nature rather than against it finds the journey easier. A good camel — strong, well-watered, even-tempered — is more valuable than gold; its loss can mean its rider's death.

### Thirst and Exhaustion

**The Scene:**
Thirst is not simply a desire for water. It is a physical experience that evolves through distinct stages.

First: the dry mouth, the mild discomfort that makes one aware of water's absence.
Then: the difficulty swallowing, the tongue feeling thick and strange, the lips beginning to crack.
Then: the headache, the confusion, the difficulty thinking clearly.
Then: the visual disturbances, the ringing in the ears, the loss of fine motor control.
And finally: collapse, unconsciousness, death.

The caravan's water rationing keeps travelers in the first two stages, uncomfortable but functional. But a miscalculation — a longer stretch between wells than expected, a water bag that leaked or spoiled — can push the entire caravan into the later stages. In the desert, the difference between survival and death is measured in cups of water.

Exhaustion is thirst's companion. The body, deprived of water, cannot thermoregulate properly. It overheats; muscles fail; the mind wanders. Men who are exhausted make mistakes that kill them: they wander from the caravan during a rest stop, they drink too much water too fast when it becomes available, they give up when they need to push forward.

### Star-Filled Night Skies

**The Scene:**
The stars of the Saharan night are beyond description, yet they must be described. There is no light pollution for a thousand miles in any direction. The sky is not decorated with stars; it is made of stars, a dome of light from horizon to horizon.

The Milky Way is a river, a road, a path through the heavens. On nights when the moon is absent, it casts visible shadows. Men lie on their backs and stare upward and feel themselves falling into the infinite.

The guides name the stars in their own languages — different names than European or Arab astronomers give, but names that have been used for generations, that encode navigational information, that carry stories and legends. The Pole Star is not always visible this far south, and other stars serve as guides: the angle of the Southern Cross, the position of particular constellations at particular hours.

### The Taste of Brackish Water

**The Scene:**
At some oases, the water is not sweet. It tastes of minerals, of salt, of the dust and chemicals that the underground aquifer has collected over geological ages. It may have a faint color — greenish with algae, brownish with sediment. It may smell of sulfur or other compounds.

The travelers drink it anyway. They have no choice.

The taste of brackish water is the taste of survival: unwanted, unpleasant, necessary. It satisfies thirst while leaving a coating on the tongue that makes one want to drink more. It may cause digestive distress, cramps, diarrhea — dangers that make an already marginal water balance more precarious.

Yet even brackish water is a gift after the desert. Men who have been rationed to a few cups a day drink the brackish water of an oasis and find it beautiful, a liquid answer to their most urgent prayers.

## Scene Seed 7: Character Types

### The Wealthy Merchant

**Physical Description:** A man of middle years, prosperous enough to afford fine robes (though he wears traveling clothes on the journey), perfumed beard, soft hands that have not done physical labor in years. He rides one of the best camels in the caravan, and several more carry his goods.

**Psychology:** He is calculating, cautious, accustomed to risk but determined to minimize it. He has made this crossing before; he knows what it demands. His wealth insulates him from the worst hardships, but it does not exempt him from the desert's indifference to human status. In his heart is a fear he never acknowledges: that this crossing will be the one from which he does not return.

**Dramatic Function:** His wealth makes him a target — for thieves, for corrupt officials, for those who resent prosperity. But his wealth also makes him valuable — his patronage protects others, his commercial network provides connections, his judgment shapes the caravan's decisions.

**Speech Pattern:** Elaborate courtesy, Islamic formulae (*inshallah*, *alhamdulillah*) woven through his speech, indirect approaches to sensitive topics, patient negotiation.

### The Desert Guide

**Physical Description:** Lean to the point of emaciation, skin darkened by sun and wind, face half-hidden by the characteristic Tuareg veil. His eyes are the only part of him that communicates clearly — and they communicate confidence, command, certainty. He moves across the sand with an economy of motion that looks effortless.

**Psychology:** He belongs to the desert in a way that city people never can. The landmarks that outsiders cannot see are as clear to him as street signs. He knows where water is, how the sand behaves, what the weather will bring. This knowledge is his power, and he guards it carefully — teaching his sons but not outsiders. He views the merchants as necessary evils, soft men who would die within days without his guidance.

**Dramatic Function:** He is both essential and unreliable. The caravan depends on him absolutely, yet he has his own loyalties (to his tribe, his family, his reputation) that may conflict with the caravan's interests. A guide who leads a caravan into a trap is a recurring fear; a guide who saves a caravan from disaster is a recurring hope.

**Speech Pattern:** Terse, direct, more comfortable with silence than with speech. When he speaks, it is about practical matters: direction, distance, danger. He does not discuss his feelings or his past.

### The Guard

**Physical Description:** Armed with sword, knife, and bow, wearing leather armor adapted to the desert climate. He may be a professional soldier, a hired man with a reputation, or a merchant's personal protector. His body shows the scars of previous conflicts.

**Psychology:** Vigilant, suspicious, accustomed to violence. He sees threats where merchants see opportunities, enemies where guides see fellow desert dwellers. His job is to worry so that others do not have to; the weight of that worry shows in his face.

**Dramatic Function:** When conflict comes — raiders, disputes within the caravan, confrontations at oases — he is the man who must respond. His competence may save lives; his incompetence may cost them. His relationship with the merchants he serves is complex: they pay him, but they also fear him, aware that his sword could be turned against them.

**Speech Pattern:** Short sentences, commands, assessments of tactical situations. He counts men, notes weapons, calculates angles of attack. His conversation is limited; his attention is not.

### The Enslaved Person

**Physical Description:** Varies widely — the enslaved people in a caravan might come from a dozen different regions, captured in wars and raids throughout West Africa. They are distinguished by their condition: thin from the journey, chained or roped together, dressed in whatever clothing they were wearing when captured.

**Psychology:** Ranges across the human response to catastrophe. Some are numb, moving through the days without hope or fear. Some are still calculating escape, watching for opportunities, preserving strength for a chance that may never come. Some have adapted, finding a way to survive by cooperating, by becoming useful, by abandoning the self they were before capture.

**Dramatic Function:** The enslaved people are the moral center of any honest narrative about the trans-Saharan trade. Their presence forces questions about commerce and conscience, about complicity and resistance. They are also individuals with their own stories, their own agency however constrained, their own futures yet to be determined.

**Speech Pattern:** Often silent — speaking without permission risks punishment. When they do speak, it may be in languages the merchants do not understand, preserving a privacy that is almost all they have left.

### The Scholar

**Physical Description:** Robes of the learned class, perhaps slightly impractical for desert travel. He carries a book or two, carefully protected from sand and sun. His hands are stained with ink; his eyes are trained for reading, not for distances.

**Psychology:** He travels for knowledge: to study with masters in the north, to purchase books for southern libraries, to observe the world as a chronicler. The commercial activity of the caravan interests him as a phenomenon to be documented, not as a means of profit. He is somewhat apart from the merchants, respected for his learning but not quite one of them.

**Dramatic Function:** He is the potential narrator — the figure who might write the account that historians would later read. His observations give the fiction permission to reflect on what the action means. But he is also a character with his own needs and vulnerabilities; his learning does not protect him from thirst or heat.

**Speech Pattern:** Quotations from the Quran and hadith, references to books and authorities, a tendency toward extended analysis, phrases in Classical Arabic that mark his education.

## Scene Seed 8: Dramatic Possibilities

### Getting Lost

**The Setup:** A sandstorm scatters the caravan. When the air clears, a small group — half a dozen travelers and a handful of camels — finds itself separated from the main body. The guide is not among them.

**The Conflict:** The group must find the main caravan, or find the route, or find water, before their supplies run out. No one knows the desert as the guide did; every direction looks the same. The group includes a merchant, a guard, two slaves, and a scholar — each with different skills, different knowledge, different ideas about what to do.

**Dramatic Questions:**
- Who takes command? The merchant has status, the guard has practical skills, the scholar has book-learned navigation.
- Do they wait for rescue, or search for the caravan? Each choice carries risks.
- How do they ration water? By status, by need, by equality?
- What becomes of the slaves? Are they freed to become partners in survival, or kept in bondage even in extremity?

### Water Shortage

**The Setup:** The well at the expected oasis is dry — poisoned, dried up, or blocked by hostile locals. The caravan's water supplies can last three more days, maybe four. The next known water source is five days distant.

**The Conflict:** The caravan master must make a choice: push on and hope, ration more severely and risk deaths from dehydration, or send a fast group ahead to scout for alternative water sources. Each option has advocates; the debate is fierce.

**Dramatic Questions:**
- How much is a life worth? If rationing must become extreme, who drinks less?
- Is the caravan master's authority absolute, or does crisis create room for challenge?
- What will men do when they believe they are dying? The slaves, who have less to lose, may become more dangerous; the merchants, who have more to lose, may become more desperate.

### Bandits

**The Setup:** Tuareg raiders intercept the caravan — not to destroy it, but to extract tribute. They demand payment for safe passage through territory they claim as their own. Their force is smaller than the caravan's, but they are desert warriors, and they may have hidden reinforcements.

**The Conflict:** The caravan master must negotiate under pressure. Pay too much, and the caravan's profit is ruined. Refuse to pay, and battle may follow — battle in which the caravan's guards, however competent, may be outmatched. The raiders know the desert, know where the caravan must go, and can return if their demands are refused.

**Dramatic Questions:**
- Is this demand legitimate tribute or simple extortion? The answer depends on perspective.
- What relationship does the guide have with the raiders? He may share their language, their tribe, their loyalties.
- If battle comes, who fights and who flees? The slaves might see opportunity in chaos.

### Deaths and Decisions

**The Setup:** A merchant falls ill — genuinely ill, with fever and delirium. He cannot ride; he may not survive even if carried. The caravan is days from any oasis, and stopping means everyone's water calculations become more precarious.

**The Conflict:** The merchant's partner demands that the caravan wait, or at least provide extra water for the sick man. Others argue that the sick man's fate is God's will, that stopping risks everyone's lives, that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the one.

**Dramatic Questions:**
- What are the limits of solidarity? At what point does obligation to an individual yield to obligation to the group?
- What is the sick man's own will? Does he want others to sacrifice for him, or does he accept his death?
- Who profits from the merchant's death? His partner, his competitors, the officials who will not have to share in his profits?

### Return Preparations

**The Setup:** The outward journey is complete; the cargo has been sold. Now the caravan must be reorganized for the return — new goods purchased, new camels acquired, the route reassessed.

**The Conflict:** Disagreements emerge about the timing and nature of the return. Some merchants want to wait for a larger caravan; others want to depart immediately. The guide's price has increased; he claims the return journey is more dangerous than the outward journey (it often was — the routes shifted seasonally, and the desert was indifferent to human schedules).

**Dramatic Questions:**
- How is success distributed? The profits from the crossing must be divided, and every division is contested.
- What has changed in the world while the caravan was crossing? News from the south may have altered the calculus of return.
- Who will not return? Some merchants stay in the north; some have died; some have had enough of the desert. The caravan that returns is not the caravan that departed.
