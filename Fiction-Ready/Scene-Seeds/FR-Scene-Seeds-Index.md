## About Scene Seeds

### What Are Scene Seeds?

Scene seeds are concentrated packages of historical information designed to spark fiction scenes. Unlike comprehensive historical profiles, scene seeds focus on what writers need to bring a moment to life: sensory details, interpersonal dynamics, dramatic tensions, and authentic period atmosphere. Each scene seed provides the raw material for one or more potential scenes in historical fiction, fantasy inspired by African history, or any narrative work drawing on this period.

### How to Use This Resource

**For Planning:** Browse the categories below to find settings and situations that might fit your narrative needs. Each scene type offers different dramatic possibilities — a royal audience provides opportunities for political intrigue, while a caravan crossing the desert offers isolation and survival drama.

**For Writing:** When you reach a scene set in one of these contexts, consult the relevant scene seed for sensory details, period-appropriate actions, and authentic atmosphere. The "Five Senses" sections help you ground readers in the physical reality of the scene.

**For Research:** Scene seeds link to deeper research profiles throughout this database. If a scene seed sparks your interest, follow the cross-references to learn more about the historical figures, places, and contexts involved.

### Design Philosophy

These scene seeds are designed with several principles in mind:

1. **Sensory Primacy:** Fiction lives in concrete sensory detail. Each scene seed prioritizes sight, sound, smell, taste, and texture over abstract information.

2. **Dramatic Potential:** Scenes need conflict, tension, or emotional stakes. Each seed identifies the dramatic possibilities inherent in the setting.

3. **Historical Authenticity:** Details are drawn from primary sources, archaeological evidence, and scholarly research. Confidence levels from the main database apply: scenes based on [Established] facts differ from those based on [Traditional/Oral] or [Speculative] material.

4. **Generic Application:** Following the project's mandate, scene seeds provide generic guidance usable by any fiction writer — not tied to specific fictional works.

5. **African Agency:** Consistent with the project's decolonizing framework, these scenes center African perspectives, agency, and complexity. External visitors (Arab travelers, Portuguese explorers) appear as characters in African-centered narratives, not the reverse.
