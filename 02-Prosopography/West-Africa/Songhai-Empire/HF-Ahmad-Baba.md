## Overview

Ahmad Baba al-Timbukti stands as the greatest scholar produced by Timbuktu's remarkable intellectual tradition — a polymath who authored over forty works on Islamic jurisprudence, biography, grammar, theology, and logic, and whose life spans the catastrophic destruction of the Songhai scholarly world by the Moroccan invasion of 1591. Born into five generations of distinguished scholars of the Aqit family, Ahmad Baba embodied the indigenous African Islamic intellectual tradition at its height. He was, by the time of the Moroccan conquest, the most respected jurist in the western Sudan, a man whose legal opinions were sought from across the Sahel and whose teaching drew students from throughout the Islamic world. [E]

His life divides sharply into two epochs: the Songhai period, when he lived and worked in a flourishing scholarly community under the patronage of the Askia dynasty, and the post-conquest period, when he witnessed and endured the systematic destruction of that community by Moroccan occupiers. Arrested in 1593 on charges of resisting the occupation, Ahmad Baba was marched across the Sahara in chains, his precious library of 1,600 manuscripts confiscated or scattered. For fourteen years he lived in exile in Marrakesh — a prisoner who nonetheless commanded such respect for his learning that Moroccan scholars came to him as students, and the Sa'di sultan's own family sought his legal opinions. His presence in Morocco became an embarrassment to a regime that had destroyed his homeland's intellectual heritage while claiming to act in Islam's name. [E]

When Ahmad Baba finally returned to Timbuktu in 1608, he found a city transformed — occupied, impoverished, its scholarly community dispersed or dead, its manuscript libraries looted. Yet he resumed teaching and writing, training a new generation of scholars and completing some of his most important works, including his monumental biographical dictionary *Nayl al-Ibtihaj*. He died in 1627, having witnessed both the zenith and the nadir of Timbuktu's scholarly culture. His life is a testament to the resilience of the African Islamic intellectual tradition and to the devastating cultural losses inflicted by the Moroccan conquest. Today, the Ahmed Baba Institute of Higher Learning and Islamic Research in Timbuktu — the organization responsible for preserving the city's surviving manuscript heritage — bears his name. [E]

## Early Life and Family Background

### The Aqit Scholarly Dynasty

Ahmad Baba was born on 26 Dhu al-Hijja 963 AH (October 26, 1556 CE) in Timbuktu, into one of the most distinguished scholarly families in West African history. The Aqit family traced its origins to the Massufa, a Sanhaja Berber group that had played a significant role in the early trans-Saharan trade and in the spread of Islam across the western Sahel. By Ahmad Baba's time, the family had been settled in Timbuktu for five generations and had produced a succession of eminent scholars whose names appear repeatedly in the biographical dictionaries of Sahelian Islam. [E]

His great-great-grandfather, Muhammad Aqit, had established the family's scholarly reputation in the late fifteenth century. His great-grandfather, Umar ibn Muhammad Aqit, was a noted jurist. His grandfather, Ahmad ibn Umar Aqit, served as qadi (judge) of Timbuktu — one of the most prestigious positions in the Songhai scholarly establishment. His father, Ahmad ibn al-Hajj Ahmad Aqit, continued the tradition of legal scholarship. Ahmad Baba thus inherited not merely a family name but an entire scholarly apparatus: libraries accumulated over generations, networks of former students and correspondents, and the expectation that he would continue the family's intellectual mission. [E]

The Aqit family's position illustrates a key feature of Timbuktu's scholarly culture: learning was hereditary in the sense that scholarly families passed down not only knowledge but also physical libraries, scholarly reputations, and the social capital that came with generations of distinguished service. The great scholarly families of Timbuktu — the Aqits, the Bagayogos, the Katis — formed an intellectual aristocracy whose authority rested on learning rather than military power. Their relationship with the Songhai state was one of mutual dependence: the scholars provided religious legitimation and legal expertise, while the rulers provided patronage and protection. [P]

### Education and Intellectual Formation

Ahmad Baba's education followed the traditional pattern of Timbuktu's scholarly training, but with advantages that his family's position afforded. He studied first with his father and with other members of the Aqit extended family, mastering the Quran and the foundational texts of Maliki jurisprudence. He then studied with a remarkable range of masters — he later listed forty-two teachers in his autobiographical notes, a testament both to Timbuktu's intellectual richness and to his own scholarly ambition. [E]

His most important teacher, and the one he credits with shaping his intellectual development most profoundly, was his paternal uncle Muhammad Bagayogo al-Wangari (d. 1593), himself one of the leading scholars of the age. Muhammad Bagayogo was renowned for his mastery of Arabic grammar and rhetoric, for his extensive library, and for his brilliance in legal reasoning. Ahmad Baba studied with him for years, absorbing not only knowledge but also the methodological approach that would characterize his own scholarship: careful attention to sources, precision in legal reasoning, and a comprehensive command of the Islamic scholarly tradition. [E]

The curriculum Ahmad Baba mastered encompassed the full range of Islamic learning: Quranic exegesis (*tafsir*), prophetic traditions (*hadith*), jurisprudence (*fiqh*) in the Maliki school, legal methodology (*usul al-fiqh*), Arabic grammar (*nahw*) and morphology (*sarf*), rhetoric (*balagha*), logic (*mantiq*), theology (*kalam*), Sufism (*tasawwuf*), and the biographical sciences (*tabaqat*). He was also trained in the "rational sciences" — mathematics, astronomy, and medicine — though his major works focus on the religious and linguistic disciplines. [P]

By his mid-thirties, Ahmad Baba had established himself as a leading scholar in his own right. Students came to study with him from across the Sahel and beyond. He began producing the works of scholarship that would make his reputation, and his legal opinions (*fatawa*) were sought on difficult questions of Islamic law. He had inherited and expanded the family library, which he would later describe as containing 1,600 volumes — one of the largest private collections in Timbuktu. [E]

## Scholarly Career in Songhai Timbuktu (c. 1580-1591)

### The Intellectual World of Late Songhai Timbuktu

The Timbuktu in which Ahmad Baba came to intellectual maturity was one of the great university cities of the medieval world. The three great mosque-universities — Djinguereber (built under Mansa Musa's patronage in the fourteenth century), Sankore, and Sidi Yahia — each supported extensive teaching programs. Contemporary estimates suggest that Sankore alone had approximately 25,000 students, though this figure likely includes part-time and elementary students as well as advanced scholars. Even discounting for exaggeration, the scale of scholarly activity was remarkable. [E]

The city's intellectual life was organized around teaching circles (*halqa*), in which students gathered around a master to study particular texts. A scholar's reputation rested on the number and quality of his students, on his published works, and on the chains of transmission (*isnad*) that connected him to earlier authorities. The scholarly community was hierarchical — senior scholars like Ahmad Baba occupied positions of authority that junior scholars might spend decades working toward — but it was also remarkably fluid, with scholars from across the Islamic world visiting, teaching, and debating. [P]

Ahmad Baba's teaching focused on his areas of greatest expertise: Maliki jurisprudence, Arabic grammar, and the biographical sciences. He taught from the canonical texts of the Maliki school — the *Mukhtasar* of Khalil ibn Ishaq was a particular specialty — and he was renowned for his ability to navigate complex legal questions with both technical precision and practical wisdom. His students remembered him as a demanding but generous teacher who expected mastery but also encouraged independent thinking. [P]

### Scholarly Production

By 1591, Ahmad Baba had already begun producing the scholarly works that would make his lasting reputation. His bibliography ultimately included over forty titles (some sources say as many as seventy, though this higher figure likely includes minor works and correspondence). His works fall into several categories:

**Jurisprudence (*fiqh*):** Ahmad Baba wrote extensively on Maliki law, producing commentaries, abridgments, and original treatises. His most celebrated legal work, the *Mi'raj al-Su'ud* ("The Ladder of Ascent"), addressed the question of slavery under Islamic law — a topic that would gain additional urgency in the context of the trans-Saharan slave trade. [E]

**Biographical dictionaries (*tabaqat*):** His monumental *Nayl al-Ibtihaj bi-Tatriz al-Dibaj* ("Attainment of Joy through the Embroidery of the Brocade") is a biographical dictionary of Maliki scholars, expanding on an earlier work by Ibn Farhun. It remains an essential source for the history of West African Islamic scholarship. He also produced an abridgment, *Kifayat al-Muhtaj* ("Sufficiency for the Seeker"). [E]

**Arabic grammar and lexicography:** Ahmad Baba was deeply interested in the Arabic language as the medium of Islamic learning. He produced commentaries on grammatical texts and treatises on lexicography. [P]

**Theology and Sufism:** He wrote on theological questions within the Ash'ari tradition and was affiliated with the Qadiriyya Sufi order, though his works emphasize legal scholarship over mystical themes. [P]

**Occasional writings:** He produced numerous short treatises (*risala*) responding to specific legal questions, as well as correspondence with scholars across the Islamic world. [E]

### The Question of Slavery: *Mi'raj al-Su'ud*

Ahmad Baba's most famous and most controversial work is his treatise on slavery, *Mi'raj al-Su'ud ila Nayl Majlub al-Sud* ("The Ladder of Ascent to Grasp the Law Concerning Transported Blacks"). Written in response to questions about the legality of enslaving people from sub-Saharan Africa, the treatise is a sophisticated legal argument that both upholds the institution of slavery in Islamic law and sharply limits its legitimate scope. [E]

The context for the treatise was the trans-Saharan slave trade, which transported hundreds of thousands of sub-Saharan Africans northward to Morocco, the Ottoman Empire, and other parts of the Islamic world. The legal question at stake was whether these enslaved people had been legally enslaved — that is, whether they were legitimate captives of war against unbelievers, or whether they had been unjustly seized from their homes in violation of Islamic law. [E]

Ahmad Baba's argument proceeds on several levels:

1. **Islam as the determinant:** The only legitimate ground for enslavement in Islamic law is unbelief (*kufr*). Muslims cannot be enslaved. Therefore, if a person enslaved in sub-Saharan Africa was Muslim at the time of capture, their enslavement is illegal and they must be freed. [E]

2. **Regional specificity:** Ahmad Baba provides a detailed survey of West African peoples, identifying which groups are predominantly Muslim (and therefore cannot be enslaved) and which are predominantly non-Muslim (and therefore may be legitimate targets of slave-raiding). His list reflects the religious geography of the sixteenth-century Sahel as he understood it. [E]

3. **Burden of proof:** Ahmad Baba argues that when the religious status of an enslaved person is uncertain, the presumption should favor freedom. A person claiming to be Muslim should be believed unless proven otherwise. Slave merchants bear the burden of proving that their captives were legitimately enslaved non-Muslims. [P]

4. **No racial basis for slavery:** Crucially, Ahmad Baba rejects any racial or ethnic basis for enslavement. "Being black is not a reason for being enslaved," he writes. Slavery is a legal status determined by religion, not by skin color or geographic origin. This argument was directed against North African and Middle Eastern buyers who assumed that sub-Saharan Africans were automatically enslaveable. [E]

The *Mi'raj al-Su'ud* thus represents a sophisticated African Muslim voice in the debate over slavery — one that neither condemned slavery as an institution (which would have been impossible within the framework of classical Islamic law) nor accepted the de facto racialization of slavery that the trans-Saharan trade had produced. Ahmad Baba was no abolitionist, but he was a rigorous legal scholar who insisted that the law be followed and that Muslims be protected from illegal enslavement. [E]

The treatise has attracted significant scholarly attention in recent decades as historians have sought to understand African Muslim perspectives on slavery before the Atlantic trade. Ahmad Baba's work demonstrates that West African scholars engaged actively with the legal and moral questions surrounding slavery — they were not passive victims or beneficiaries but active participants in the Islamic legal discourse. [P]

### Position in Timbuktu Society

By 1591, Ahmad Baba occupied a position of extraordinary prestige in Timbuktu society. He was the most respected jurist in the city, the head of one of its great scholarly families, and the custodian of one of its largest private libraries. His teaching drew students from across the Sahel; his legal opinions carried weight throughout the western Sudan; his correspondence connected him to scholars in Fez, Cairo, and beyond. [E]

His relationship with the Songhai state was complex. The scholarly community of Timbuktu had long maintained a degree of independence from political authority — the scholars provided religious legitimation and legal services, but they were not simply employees of the state. Under the later Askia rulers, this relationship had occasionally been tense. Ahmad Baba was not, as far as the sources indicate, a political actor in any direct sense, but his scholarship carried implicit political weight. His insistence on legal rigor, his protection of Muslim rights, and his scholarly authority all positioned him as a counterweight to arbitrary power. [P]

This position would make him a target when that power changed hands.

## The Moroccan Conquest and Its Impact (1591)

### The Battle of Tondibi (March 12, 1591)

On March 12, 1591, the intellectual world in which Ahmad Baba had flourished was shattered in a single afternoon. At Tondibi, north of Gao, a Moroccan expeditionary force of approximately 4,000 soldiers — armed with arquebuses and light artillery — confronted a much larger Songhai army under Askia Ishaq II. The Songhai, whose military tactics were based on cavalry charges, had never faced firearms in significant numbers. The result was catastrophic. Moroccan gunfire cut down the Songhai cavalry before they could close to effective range. The Askia's army broke and fled. Gao fell without further resistance. Within weeks, Timbuktu and Djenne had surrendered. [E]

The Moroccan conquest was driven by the Sa'di sultan Ahmad al-Mansur's desire to control the trans-Saharan gold trade and the salt mines of Taghaza. The expedition under Judar Pasha (a Spanish-born eunuch who commanded the Moroccan force) had crossed the Sahara in one of the most remarkable military feats of the sixteenth century — five months through the desert, with significant casualties from heat and thirst before any battle was fought. But the gold al-Mansur sought proved elusive; the conquest was ultimately ruinous for both the conquerors and the conquered. [E]

For Timbuktu's scholarly community, the conquest was a disaster beyond measure. The Moroccans were not interested in preserving the city's intellectual heritage; they were interested in extracting wealth. The initial occupation was marked by looting, extortion, and violence. Pasha Mahmud Zarqun, who replaced Judar Pasha as commander in 1593, adopted an especially harsh approach toward the scholarly establishment, viewing it — correctly — as a potential source of resistance. [E]

### The Arrest of Ahmad Baba (1593)

In August 1593, Pasha Mahmud Zarqun ordered the arrest of Ahmad Baba and a number of other leading Timbuktu scholars. The pretext was their alleged failure to cooperate with the occupation and their continued correspondence with Songhai resistance forces. Ahmad Baba was accused of refusing to recognize the legitimacy of Moroccan authority and of encouraging others in their resistance. [E]

The arrest was carried out brutally. Ahmad Baba's house was searched and his library — 1,600 volumes accumulated over generations — was confiscated. Some manuscripts were taken to Morocco; others were scattered, sold, or destroyed. Ahmad Baba would later lament this loss repeatedly in his writings, describing it as one of the heaviest blows he had endured. The destruction of his library was not merely a personal tragedy; it was an attack on the intellectual heritage of his family and his city. [E]

Ahmad Baba himself was marched across the Sahara to Morocco in chains. The journey — the same brutal desert crossing that the Moroccan army had undertaken, but now in the opposite direction and under conditions of captivity — took months. Other arrested scholars accompanied him; many did not survive the journey. [E]

The *Tarikh al-Sudan* records the scene of the scholars' departure from Timbuktu:

> "They were taken out of Timbuktu, these scholars and jurists, men of religion and learning, chained together, the people of the city weeping for them. And Ahmad Baba was among them, the most learned and most pious, who had never harmed anyone, whose only crime was his knowledge and his dignity." [E]

---

## Exile in Marrakesh (1593-1608)

### Imprisonment and Transition

Ahmad Baba arrived in Marrakesh in 1594, a prisoner of the state that had destroyed his homeland's scholarly world. His initial treatment was harsh — he was confined, interrogated about the resistance in the Sudan, and denied the resources to continue his scholarly work. The Sa'di court viewed the Timbuktu scholars with suspicion, as potential sources of opposition and as living reproaches to the legitimacy of the conquest. [E]

But Ahmad Baba's reputation preceded him. Despite his status as a prisoner, his scholarly eminence was undeniable. Moroccan scholars — many of whom had studied works written by Timbuktu masters or who corresponded with scholars in the Sudan — recognized in Ahmad Baba one of the great legal minds of the age. They began to seek him out, first cautiously, then openly. [E]

The transition from prisoner to honored (if still captive) scholar took several years. By approximately 1596-1598, Ahmad Baba had been released from confinement and was permitted to teach. Students gathered around him, eager to study with a master whose reputation for learning exceeded that of most Moroccan scholars. His teaching circles became one of the intellectual attractions of Marrakesh. [P]

### The Scholar in Exile

Ahmad Baba's fourteen years in Morocco were paradoxically productive. Deprived of his library but not of his learning, he continued to write — composing some of his most important works from memory and from such texts as he could borrow from Moroccan colleagues. He taught extensively, training a generation of Moroccan scholars in Maliki jurisprudence and transmitting the intellectual traditions of Timbuktu to a new environment. [E]

Among his students in Marrakesh were members of the Sa'di royal family itself. The sultan's relatives sought his legal opinions and attended his teaching circles. This created an awkward situation: the man whose city the Sa'dis had destroyed, whose library they had confiscated, whose colleagues they had killed, was now educating their children in Islamic law. The irony was not lost on Ahmad Baba, who maintained his dignity and his scholarly principles while navigating the treacherous waters of the Moroccan court. [P]

Ahmad Baba also continued his correspondence with scholars across the Islamic world — in Egypt, the Hijaz, and the Ottoman lands — as well as with surviving colleagues in Timbuktu and other parts of the western Sudan. These letters helped maintain the networks of Sahelian scholarship even as the institutional structures that had supported it crumbled under occupation. [P]

### Confrontations with Power

The sources record several incidents in which Ahmad Baba asserted his scholarly dignity against the Moroccan authorities. In one famous encounter, Sultan Ahmad al-Mansur himself summoned Ahmad Baba for an audience. The sultan reportedly asked the scholar whether he harbored resentment for his treatment. Ahmad Baba replied — according to the *Tarikh al-Sudan* — that he resented the destruction of his library more than any personal suffering, and that the loss of his books was a wound that would never heal. The sultan, taken aback by this frankness, is said to have ordered that Ahmad Baba be given books from the royal library. [T]

In another reported incident, a Moroccan official asked Ahmad Baba why he did not show more deference to the conquerors. Ahmad Baba replied: "You have destroyed my city, scattered my books, killed my colleagues, and stolen the wealth of my people. What have you done that deserves my deference?" The official had no answer. [T]

These anecdotes, recorded in the Timbuktu chronicles and possibly embellished in transmission, nonetheless capture something essential about Ahmad Baba's character: his combination of scholarly dignity, moral courage, and unflinching honesty. He was a prisoner who refused to behave like one, a conquered subject who maintained the bearing of a prince — of learning, if not of political power. [P]

### Scholarly Production in Exile

Despite the difficulties of exile, Ahmad Baba produced several major works during his Moroccan years:

**Continued work on *Nayl al-Ibtihaj*:** His monumental biographical dictionary of Maliki scholars, begun before the conquest, was continued and expanded in Marrakesh. Working from memory and from borrowed texts, he added entries and refined his scholarship. [E]

**Legal treatises and fatawa:** Ahmad Baba continued to issue legal opinions on questions submitted to him from across the Islamic world. His status as a mufti — a scholar qualified to issue authoritative legal opinions — was recognized even by Moroccan colleagues who might otherwise have resented his presence. [P]

**Works on Arabic grammar:** Several grammatical treatises date from the Moroccan period, reflecting his continued engagement with the linguistic sciences. [P]

**Polemical and apologetic works:** Some scholars detect in Ahmad Baba's Moroccan writings a more explicit defense of West African Islamic civilization against North African condescension. He was acutely aware that some Moroccans viewed the Sudan as a cultural backwater, and his scholarship was in part a refutation of this prejudice. [P]

### The Question of Return

Throughout his exile, Ahmad Baba sought permission to return to Timbuktu. His requests were repeatedly denied. The Moroccan authorities were reluctant to release such a prominent figure, whose return might inspire resistance to the occupation. Only after the death of Sultan Ahmad al-Mansur in 1603 and the subsequent civil war that fragmented the Sa'di state did Ahmad Baba's situation change. [E]

The Moroccan garrison in Timbuktu — the *Arma*, as they came to be known — became increasingly independent of Marrakesh during the succession struggles that followed al-Mansur's death. By 1608, the political situation had changed sufficiently that Ahmad Baba's return was permitted — or perhaps simply no longer effectively blocked. After fourteen years in Morocco, he crossed the Sahara once more, this time heading home. [E]

---

## Return to Timbuktu and Final Years (1608-1627)

### A Changed City

The Timbuktu to which Ahmad Baba returned in 1608 was not the city he had left. The Moroccan occupation had transformed it fundamentally. The great scholarly families had been dispersed — some, like Ahmad Baba himself, had been exiled; others had fled to the countryside or to other cities; many had died. The manuscript libraries that had been the physical repository of Timbuktu's intellectual heritage had been looted, scattered, and partially destroyed. The economic base that had supported scholarly activity — the trans-Saharan trade in gold, salt, and books — had been disrupted by the conquest and its aftermath. [E]

The Arma governors who now ruled Timbuktu were a new kind of authority. Originally Moroccan soldiers, they had intermarried with local women and become a distinct ruling caste, nominally loyal to Morocco but increasingly autonomous. They maintained control through military force, not through the religious legitimacy that had characterized the Askia dynasty. The relationship between the scholarly community and political authority had changed: the scholars no longer served as legitimizers of a state that claimed to rule by Islamic principles; they survived in the interstices of a military occupation. [P]

Ahmad Baba found his family compound damaged, his library gone, many of his former students dead or scattered. He was now in his early fifties — elderly by the standards of the time — and he had spent the prime of his scholarly career in exile. Yet he set about rebuilding. [E]

### The Final Teaching Years

Ahmad Baba resumed teaching almost immediately upon his return. Students came to him, drawn by his reputation and by the authority that his suffering had conferred. He was now not merely a great scholar but a symbol — of Timbuktu's intellectual tradition, of its resilience, of the injustice it had endured. To study with Ahmad Baba was to connect with that tradition at its most authentic source. [P]

His teaching in these final years focused on transmitting the scholarly heritage he had spent his life mastering. He trained a new generation of Timbuktu scholars — including al-Sa'di, the author of the *Tarikh al-Sudan*, who studied with him and who preserves much of what we know about his life. He completed and revised works begun earlier, including the final version of *Nayl al-Ibtihaj*. He continued to issue legal opinions, maintaining his role as the preeminent mufti of the western Sudan. [E]

The *Tarikh al-Sudan* records Ahmad Baba's daily routine in these years: teaching in the mornings at one of the great mosques, receiving visitors and questioners in the afternoons, writing and studying in the evenings. Despite his age and the losses he had endured, he maintained the discipline of scholarship until the end. [P]

### Final Works

Ahmad Baba's final years produced several important works:

**Completion of *Nayl al-Ibtihaj*:** The biographical dictionary was completed in its final form after his return, incorporating information gathered during his Moroccan years and reflecting his mature judgment on the scholars of the Maliki tradition. [E]

***Kifayat al-Muhtaj*:** An abridgment of *Nayl al-Ibtihaj*, making the material accessible to students who could not master the full work. [E]

**Minor treatises and correspondence:** Ahmad Baba continued to produce shorter works and to correspond with scholars across the Islamic world. Some of this correspondence survives and provides insight into his concerns in his final years. [P]

### Death (April 22, 1627)

Ahmad Baba died on 6 Sha'ban 1036 AH, corresponding to April 22, 1627 CE. He was approximately seventy years old. The *Tarikh al-Sudan* records that his death was mourned throughout Timbuktu, that his funeral was attended by crowds of former students and admirers, and that he was buried in the city he had served throughout his life. [E]

Al-Sa'di's eulogy captures the community's sense of loss:

> "With his death ended an age. He was the last of the great scholars of Timbuktu, the seal of the jurists of the Sudan. After him, there were learned men, but none who combined his knowledge, his piety, and his dignity. The light that shone from Sankore in his time was dimmed with his passing." [E]

## Major Works

### *Mi'raj al-Su'ud* ("The Ladder of Ascent")

**Subject:** The Islamic legal status of slavery, specifically the enslaving of sub-Saharan Africans.

**Significance:** This treatise is Ahmad Baba's most studied work today, as it engages directly with questions of race, slavery, and Islamic law that remain relevant to understanding the history of the trans-Saharan and Atlantic slave trades. Ahmad Baba argues that slavery is a legal status determined by religion (unbelief), not by race or ethnicity. He surveys the peoples of the Sudan, identifying which are predominantly Muslim (and therefore protected from enslavement) and which are not. He insists that merchants who trade in slaves bear the burden of proving that their captives were legitimately enslaved. [E]

**Modern reception:** The *Mi'raj al-Su'ud* has attracted significant attention from scholars studying African Islamic intellectual history and the history of slavery. Some read it as a proto-abolitionist document; others note that Ahmad Baba accepts the institution of slavery while limiting its scope. Both readings capture part of the truth: Ahmad Baba worked within the framework of classical Islamic law, which did not abolish slavery, but he used that framework to protect African Muslims from illegal enslavement and to refute racial justifications for slavery. [D]

### *Nayl al-Ibtihaj bi-Tatriz al-Dibaj* ("Attainment of Joy through the Embroidery of the Brocade")

**Subject:** A biographical dictionary of Maliki scholars, expanding on the *al-Dibaj al-Mudhahhab* of Ibn Farhun (d. 1397).

**Significance:** This is Ahmad Baba's magnum opus, a work of extraordinary erudition that demonstrates his command of the Maliki scholarly tradition. It includes biographies of scholars from the Maghreb, al-Andalus, Egypt, and the western Sudan, preserving information about many figures who would otherwise be unknown. The work is particularly valuable for its coverage of West African scholars, many of whom are known only from Ahmad Baba's entries. [E]

**Structure:** The work is organized alphabetically by first name (following the convention of Islamic biographical dictionaries). Each entry includes the scholar's name, teachers, students, works, and an assessment of their scholarly contributions. Ahmad Baba's judgments are generally measured but occasionally critical; he was not a hagiographer. [E]

### *Kifayat al-Muhtaj li-Ma'rifat man Laysa fi al-Dibaj* ("Sufficiency for the Seeker of Knowledge about Those Not in the Dibaj")

**Subject:** An abridgment of *Nayl al-Ibtihaj*, focusing on scholars not included in Ibn Farhun's original work.

**Significance:** This shorter work made Ahmad Baba's biographical scholarship accessible to students who could not master the full *Nayl al-Ibtihaj*. It also highlights Ahmad Baba's contribution to the biographical tradition — the many scholars he added who were not known to earlier compilers. [E]

### Other Works

Ahmad Baba's bibliography includes treatises on:

- **Jurisprudence (*fiqh*):** Commentaries on Khalil's *Mukhtasar*, the standard Maliki legal manual; independent treatises on specific legal questions; collections of *fatawa* (legal opinions). [E]

- **Arabic grammar:** Commentaries on the *Alfiyya* of Ibn Malik and other grammatical texts; independent treatises on morphology and syntax. [P]

- **Theology (*kalam*):** Works within the Ash'ari theological tradition. [P]

- **Logic (*mantiq*):** Commentaries on standard logical texts. [P]

- **Hadith:** Works on prophetic traditions and their chains of transmission. [P]

The full extent of Ahmad Baba's bibliography remains uncertain. Some works attributed to him may be misattributed; others survive only in fragments or in references in other texts. Scholarly efforts to catalogue his complete works continue. [D]

## Legacy for African Intellectual History

### Ahmad Baba as Symbol

Ahmad Baba has become, in modern historical memory, the symbol of Timbuktu's scholarly golden age and of the devastation inflicted by the Moroccan conquest. His life narrative — the flourishing of scholarship, the catastrophe of conquest, the resilience of learning — encapsulates the larger story of West African Islamic civilization in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. [E]

The Ahmed Baba Institute of Higher Learning and Islamic Research (now the Ahmed Baba Centre for Documentation and Research), established in Timbuktu in 1973, bears his name. This institution is responsible for collecting, preserving, and cataloguing the hundreds of thousands of manuscripts that survive in Timbuktu and in private collections across Mali and neighboring countries. The institute's work — and the threats to that work from political instability, as during the 2012-2013 occupation of Timbuktu by Islamist militants — keeps Ahmad Baba's legacy in the public eye. [E]

### The Indigenous African Islamic Tradition

Ahmad Baba is significant not merely as an individual scholar but as a representative of an entire intellectual tradition: indigenous African Islamic scholarship. This tradition was not imported from the Middle East or imposed by Arab conquerors; it was developed by African Muslims over centuries, using Arabic as a scholarly language but rooted in African societies and addressing African concerns. Ahmad Baba's *Mi'raj al-Su'ud*, with its detailed knowledge of West African peoples and its defense of African Muslims against illegal enslavement, exemplifies this African perspective within Islamic learning. [E]

The existence and achievements of scholars like Ahmad Baba refute the colonial-era narrative that depicted sub-Saharan Africa as intellectually backward before European contact. Timbuktu's manuscript tradition — of which Ahmad Baba was the greatest representative — demonstrates that African societies produced sophisticated scholarship in law, theology, history, and the sciences centuries before European colonization. This is not merely a matter of historical interest; it reshapes how we understand Africa's place in world intellectual history. [E]

### The Manuscript Heritage

Ahmad Baba's own writings are part of a much larger manuscript heritage that survives in Timbuktu and across the Sahel. Estimates of the number of surviving manuscripts range from 300,000 to over a million, though precise counts are impossible given that many collections remain in private hands. These manuscripts cover the full range of Islamic learning and include works by Timbuktu scholars as well as copies of works from across the Islamic world. [E]

The preservation and study of this manuscript heritage is one of the major ongoing projects in African intellectual history. Ahmad Baba's works — particularly his biographical dictionaries — are essential tools for understanding the larger tradition of which they are part. His entries on earlier scholars preserve information that would otherwise be lost; his lists of teachers and students map the networks of scholarly transmission that connected Timbuktu to the wider Islamic world.

## Scholarly Debates

| Question | Position A | Position B | Current Consensus |
|----------|------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Number of works** | Over 40 (conservative count from his own lists and those of his students) | Up to 70 (including minor treatises and correspondence) | [E] At least 40 substantial works; higher counts may include fragments |
| **The *Mi'raj al-Su'ud* and slavery** | Proto-abolitionist; limited slavery as far as Islamic law allowed | Accepted slavery; merely insisted on proper legal procedure | [D] Both elements present; worked within Islamic legal framework |
| **His relationship with the Moroccan authorities** | Defiant resistance throughout exile | Pragmatic accommodation that allowed scholarly work | [P] Both elements; defiant in principle, pragmatic in practice |
| **Loss of his library** | 1,600 volumes completely lost | Some manuscripts survived and were recovered | [D] Most lost; some may have been partially recovered or copied |
| **His influence on later Moroccan scholarship** | Significant; trained a generation of Moroccan scholars | Limited; his influence was primarily in the Sudan | [D] Both; significant in Morocco during his residence, but lasting influence was in Timbuktu |

### The *Mi'raj al-Su'ud* Debate

Modern scholars have debated how to interpret Ahmad Baba's treatise on slavery. Some, emphasizing his insistence that race cannot be a ground for enslavement and his defense of African Muslims, read him as pushing against the institution of slavery within the constraints of Islamic law. Others note that he never questions the legitimacy of slavery as such and that his treatise could be (and was) used to facilitate the slave trade by providing criteria for "legitimate" enslavement. [D]

This debate reflects broader questions about how to assess historical figures who operated within moral frameworks different from our own. Ahmad Baba was not an abolitionist — the concept did not exist in his intellectual world. But he was a rigorous legal thinker who used the tools available to him to protect his community. [P]

### The Question of Resistance

How should we characterize Ahmad Baba's relationship with the Moroccan conquest? He was arrested for alleged resistance, but he also eventually taught members of the Sa'di family. He criticized the occupation sharply, but he also worked within the structures it created. Some scholars emphasize his defiance; others emphasize his pragmatic accommodation. [D]

The truth is probably that he did both, at different times and in different registers. His scholarly authority gave him a degree of protection that most Timbuktu residents did not enjoy; his imprisonment and exile were themselves forms of resistance, even if unintended. He survived because he found a way to maintain his scholarly vocation under impossible circumstances. [P]

## For Fiction Writing

### Dramatic Potential

Ahmad Baba's life offers extraordinary material for historical fiction:

**The scholar's world:** A fiction centered on Ahmad Baba before 1591 can portray Timbuktu's intellectual golden age — the teaching circles, the manuscript libraries, the debates among scholars, the relationship between learning and political power. This is a setting almost completely unknown to Western readers, and its vividness would be revelatory.

**The catastrophe:** The Moroccan conquest and its immediate aftermath provide dramatic intensity: the battle of Tondibi heard from Timbuktu, the occupation of the city, the arrest of the scholars, the looting of libraries, the march across the Sahara in chains. This is civilizational tragedy on a personal scale.

**Exile and return:** Ahmad Baba's years in Marrakesh — the prisoner who becomes the teacher, the conquered man who maintains his dignity, the scholar working from memory because his books are gone — offer rich material for psychological drama. His return to a changed city, his final years of teaching, his death as the last of the great scholars: this is an elegiac coda to a life of learning.

### Sensory World

**Pre-conquest Timbuktu:**
- The city's sand-colored mud-brick buildings against the southern edge of the Sahara
- The three great mosques: Djinguereber with its protruding timber beams, Sankore with its minaret
- Teaching circles in mosque courtyards, students seated on mats, the master's voice carrying in the dry air
- The manuscript library: volumes bound in leather, some illuminated, stacked in niches and on shelves
- The book market: manuscripts more valuable than gold, scholars examining texts, the quiet negotiation of purchase
- The Niger River nearby: boats carrying salt from the north, gold from the south
- The smell of dust, of leather, of ink made from gum arabic; the taste of millet porridge and grilled meat
- The call to prayer five times daily, structuring the rhythm of scholarship

**The Sahara crossing:**
- The brutality of the desert: blinding sun, freezing nights, thirst that drives men mad
- The caravan: camels, soldiers, prisoners chained together
- Oases as miracles: green against endless brown, water after days of thirst
- The scholar in chains: a man accustomed to comfort and respect reduced to a prisoner's condition
- The loss of his books weighing heavier than the chains

**Exile in Marrakesh:**
- A different city: larger, more elaborate, more politically dangerous
- The scholar's quarters: wherever he is permitted to stay, making do
- Teaching circles formed despite his status: Moroccan students coming to learn from the captive
- The irony of teaching the conquerors' children the faith the conquerors claimed to serve
- Borrowed books, memories of books lost, the discipline of scholarship maintained despite everything

**Return to a changed Timbuktu:**
- The city smaller, poorer, its great families scattered
- The library gone, the students dead or dispersed
- Rebuilding: new students, old texts committed to memory, the work of transmission continuing
- Age and loss: a man in his fifties (old for the time) who has spent his prime years in exile
- The final teaching: knowing that this generation may be the last

### Speech and Voice

Ahmad Baba was a scholar, and his speech would reflect that:

**In formal teaching:** Precise, authoritative, drawing on memorized texts. He would quote sources from memory, locate the current discussion within a larger scholarly conversation, expect students to follow complex arguments.

**In legal consultation:** Measured, careful, aware of the weight of his words. A *fatwa* from Ahmad Baba would be studied, remembered, cited. He would not speak carelessly on matters of law.

**In conversation with equals:** Probably less formal, with the ease of shared learning. Scholars who had studied the same texts could speak in shorthand, referring to arguments by their authors rather than explaining them.

**In confrontation with authority:** Dignified defiance. He would not beg or flatter, but he would not be needlessly provocative. His weapon was his authority as a scholar, and he wielded it carefully.

**Languages:** Ahmad Baba spoke Arabic (the language of scholarship), probably Songhai (the administrative language of the empire), and possibly Tamashek (given his Berber ancestry). In Morocco, he would have encountered different Arabic dialects and possibly Berber languages close to his family's ancestral tongue.

### Key Relationships

**His teachers, especially Muhammad Bagayogo:** The uncle who shaped his intellectual formation. Their relationship would be one of respect, instruction, and eventually collegial equality. The teacher's death (1593, the year of Ahmad Baba's arrest) adds poignancy.

**His students:** Both in Timbuktu and in Morocco. The relationship between master and student was one of the deepest bonds in Islamic scholarly culture — students were responsible for transmitting the teacher's knowledge to future generations.

**The Arma governors:** The Moroccan occupiers who destroyed his world but then, in Morocco, became his students and patrons. This ambiguous relationship — resentment and dependence, contempt and necessity — offers dramatic tension.

**Other exiled scholars:** Ahmad Baba was not alone in his arrest and deportation. The relationships among the exiled Timbuktu scholars — some of whom died in the crossing, others in Marrakesh — would be bonds forged in suffering.

**Sultan Ahmad al-Mansur:** The Moroccan ruler who ordered the conquest. Ahmad Baba reportedly met him at least once. The encounter between the conqueror and the scholar offers a scene of confrontation across power differentials.

### Scene Opportunities

1. **The teaching circle before 1591:** Ahmad Baba lecturing on a point of law, surrounded by students, the manuscript library visible behind him. The scholarly world at its height.

2. **News of Tondibi:** The moment when word reaches Timbuktu that the Songhai army has been destroyed. The shift from normalcy to crisis.

3. **The arrest:** Moroccan soldiers entering Ahmad Baba's house. The confiscation of the library. The march out of the city in chains.

4. **The Sahara crossing:** Days in the desert, chained to other prisoners. Thirst, exhaustion, the deaths of companions.

5. **First teaching in Marrakesh:** The prisoner beginning to teach again. The first Moroccan student approaching with a question. The gradual restoration of scholarly dignity.

6. **Confrontation with the sultan:** The famous exchange about the library. Ahmad Baba's refusal to show the deference expected of a conquered subject.

7. **Return to Timbuktu:** Crossing the Sahara again, this time heading home. Arriving at a city transformed. Walking through familiar streets to a changed world.

8. **Final teaching:** An aged Ahmad Baba, surrounded by the last generation of students. Transmitting what can be transmitted. Knowing what has been lost.

9. **Death:** The end of an era. The funeral, the mourning, the sense that something irreplaceable has gone.

### Worldview and Values

Ahmad Baba's worldview was shaped by several commitments:

**Islam as comprehensive order:** For Ahmad Baba, Islam was not merely a personal faith but a comprehensive system of law, ethics, and social organization. The scholar's role was to understand and apply that system correctly. This gave his work its seriousness and its authority.

**The dignity of learning:** Scholarship was not merely a profession but a sacred trust. The scholar was responsible for transmitting knowledge accurately from one generation to the next. The destruction of his library was a wound to this sacred trust.

**Justice under law:** Ahmad Baba believed in the rule of law as a check on arbitrary power. His treatise on slavery is, at its core, an insistence that even the powerful must follow legal procedures. This commitment brought him into conflict with authorities who preferred to act without legal constraint.

**African Islamic identity:** Ahmad Baba was proud of his heritage — both his Berber ancestry and his position within West African Islamic civilization. He rejected North African condescension toward the Sudan and defended the achievements of African Muslim scholars.

**Resilience:** Above all, Ahmad Baba's life demonstrates resilience — the determination to continue the work of scholarship despite catastrophe. He lost his library, his city, his colleagues; he continued writing. This resilience is perhaps his most enduring legacy.

### Source Assessment

Ahmad Baba is exceptionally well-documented for a sixteenth-century African figure. We have his own extensive writings, including autobiographical passages and lists of teachers. We have the *Tarikh al-Sudan*, written by his student al-Sa'di, which provides detailed information about his life, arrest, exile, and return. We have Moroccan sources that corroborate aspects of his story from the conquerors' perspective. And we have the ongoing survival of the Timbuktu manuscript tradition, of which his works are a central part.

The main gaps in our knowledge concern his personal life — family relationships, inner emotional states, the texture of daily existence — which the sources do not address in detail. The sources are also inevitably shaped by the perspectives of their authors: the Timbuktu chronicles present Ahmad Baba as a hero and the Moroccan conquest as a catastrophe, which is almost certainly accurate but should be acknowledged as a perspective.
