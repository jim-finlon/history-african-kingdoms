## Overview

Sunni Ali Ber was the warrior-king who transformed the small Songhai state centered on Gao into the largest empire medieval West Africa had ever seen. Through twenty-eight years of relentless campaigning (1464-1492), he captured Timbuktu from its Tuareg occupiers, conquered the wealthy trading city of Djenne after a legendary siege, and extended Songhai dominion across the entire Middle Niger. By his death in 1492, he had constructed the territorial foundation upon which his successor, Askia Muhammad I, would build one of Africa's most sophisticated administrative states. Sunni Ali was, by any measure, one of the great military geniuses of the fifteenth century.

Yet Sunni Ali is also one of the most controversial figures in West African historiography, and understanding him requires grappling with the biased nature of our primary sources. Almost everything we know about him comes from two chronicles — the *Tarikh al-Sudan* and the *Tarikh al-Fattash* — both written by Islamic scholars associated with Timbuktu, the city whose learned class Sunni Ali persecuted. These chronicles portray him as a tyrant, a hypocrite who pretended to Islam while practicing indigenous religion, a persecutor of scholars and holy men, and a ruler whose military brilliance was matched only by his impiety. They contrast him unfavorably with Askia Muhammad, the devout Muslim general who overthrew Sunni Ali's son and dynasty, and whose court patronized the very scholars who wrote these accounts.

The question of Sunni Ali's true character — whether he was indeed the brutal enemy of Islam the chronicles describe, or a pragmatic ruler whose religious syncretism and conflicts with the Timbuktu ulama have been exaggerated by hostile sources — remains actively debated by historians. What is beyond dispute is his military achievement: he took a small kingdom overshadowed by Mali's declining empire and turned it into the dominant power of the Western Sudan. The Songhai Empire that Europeans first encountered in the sixteenth century — the empire of Timbuktu's legendary wealth and learning — was built on foundations Sunni Ali laid through decades of warfare.

## Early Life and Background

### Family and Lineage

Sunni Ali was born into the Za (or Dia) dynasty, also called the Sonni or Sunni dynasty, which had ruled the Songhai people at Gao for centuries. According to the *Tarikh al-Sudan*, the Za dynasty traced its origins to a figure named Za al-Ayaman who came to Gao from Yemen in the seventh century — though this origin story likely reflects later attempts to connect Songhai's rulers to prestigious Arabian lineages rather than historical migration. What is clear is that by Sunni Ali's time, the dynasty had ruled Gao for over five hundred years, making it one of the longest-ruling lineages in West African history. [T/P]

The *Tarikh al-Sudan* lists Sunni Ali as the sixteenth ruler of the Sonni dynasty and provides names for his immediate predecessors. His father was Sunni Muhammad Da'o (or Madao), and he succeeded his brother Sunni Sulayman Dama around 1464. The circumstances of the succession — whether Sunni Ali inherited normally, seized power, or was chosen over other claimants — are not recorded. [P]

According to the chronicles, Sunni Ali's mother came from Fara, a region associated with the worship of traditional spirits and the practice of what the Muslim chroniclers called "sorcery." This maternal lineage is cited as the source of Sunni Ali's alleged attachment to indigenous religion and his command of supernatural powers. The *Tarikh al-Fattash* specifically attributes his religious character to this maternal inheritance: "He performed the practices of his mother's people." Whether this reflects historical fact or represents a literary device to explain his hostility to the Timbuktu ulama cannot be determined. [T/D]

### The Songhai Before Sunni Ali

To understand Sunni Ali's achievement, one must understand what the Songhai state was before he transformed it. Gao, located on the Niger Bend, had been a significant trading city since at least the eighth century, positioned at the eastern end of the trans-Saharan trade network where goods from the south (gold, slaves, kola nuts) met goods from the north (salt, cloth, manufactured items). The Za dynasty had converted to Islam by around the eleventh century — royal tombstones in Arabic script attest to this — making Gao one of the earliest Islamized polities in the Western Sudan. [E]

For much of the Mali Empire's dominance (c. 1235-1400), Songhai had been a subordinate state, acknowledging Malian suzerainty and paying tribute to the Mansa. The relationship was not one of complete subjugation — Gao maintained its own rulers and considerable autonomy — but Mali's power constrained Songhai's ambitions. Two Sunni rulers, according to tradition, had even been hostages at the Mali court in their youth, including possibly Sunni Ali's grandfather. [P]

By the mid-fifteenth century, however, Mali was in advanced decline. Internal succession disputes, the loss of Timbuktu to the Tuareg (1433), Mossi raids from the south, and the general fragmentation of imperial authority created a power vacuum in the Niger Bend. The Tuareg, pastoral nomads from the Sahara, controlled Timbuktu and posed a constant threat to sedentary settlements. The Mossi kingdoms to the south raided northward with impunity. The wealthy trading city of Djenne maintained its independence behind formidable defenses. This was the world Sunni Ali inherited — and set out to conquer.

### Path to Power

Little is known about Sunni Ali's life before he became ruler. The chronicles, hostile to him, show no interest in his youth, his education, or his character before he came to power. The *Tarikh al-Sudan* does mention that when he became Sunni in 1464, he immediately began military operations, suggesting either pre-existing martial experience or an ambition long deferred.

One significant detail emerges: the chronicles claim that when Sunni Ali was young, a scholar named al-Maghili (or possibly another religious figure) predicted that he would grow up to be a tyrant and persecutor of religion. This "prophecy" — conveniently fulfilled by the Sunni Ali of the chronicles — should be treated skeptically. It may be a retrospective construction designed to fit his career into a narrative of religious warning ignored. Alternatively, if true, it might reflect real tensions between the Songhai royal family and religious authorities that predated Sunni Ali's reign. [T]

## Reign and Achievements

### Military Campaigns: Overview

Sunni Ali's twenty-eight-year reign (1464-1492) was characterized by nearly continuous warfare. The chronicles record campaign after campaign — against the Tuareg of Timbuktu, the defenders of Djenne, the Mossi kingdoms to the south, the Fulani pastoralists, the Dogon in their cliff dwellings, and various other peoples of the Niger Bend and beyond. He is said to have personally led most of these expeditions, spending more time in the field than in his capital at Gao.

The *Tarikh al-Sudan* summarizes: "He was always victorious and never suffered defeat. He was always conquering and never conquered." Even accounting for hyperbole, this assessment reflects a military career of extraordinary success. Sunni Ali expanded Songhai from a regional power centered on Gao to an empire stretching from the Niger Bend to the approaches of Hausaland, and from the Saharan borderlands to the fringes of the forest zone. [P]

### The Capture of Timbuktu (1468)

**Background:**
Timbuktu, founded as a Tuareg seasonal camp in the eleventh or twelfth century, had grown into one of the most important cities in the Western Sudan — a center of trans-Saharan trade and, increasingly, of Islamic scholarship. Under Mali's patronage, especially during the reign of Mansa Musa (r. 1312-1337), Timbuktu's great mosques and schools had attracted scholars from across the Islamic world.

In 1433, however, the Tuareg under their chief Akil Ag-Amalwal had seized Timbuktu from Mali's weakened grip. For thirty-five years, the Tuareg controlled the city, extracting revenue while allowing its commercial and scholarly activities to continue. The Timbuktu ulama (religious scholars) apparently accommodated themselves to Tuareg rule, maintaining their institutions under new overlords. [E]

**The Campaign:**
Shortly after becoming Sunni, Ali turned his attention to Timbuktu. According to the *Tarikh al-Sudan*, the scholars of Timbuktu, suffering under Tuareg exactions, sent a secret message to Sunni Ali inviting him to liberate the city. Whether this invitation was genuine or is a later construction to explain what followed is debated.

Sunni Ali moved swiftly. The *Tarikh al-Sudan* claims he covered the distance from Gao to Timbuktu — approximately 300 kilometers — in a single night, a clear exaggeration reflecting his reputation for speed and surprise. He entered Timbuktu in 1468, driving out Akil Ag-Amalwal and the Tuareg forces. [E]

**The Aftermath — The Timbuktu Persecution:**
What happened next is the most controversial episode of Sunni Ali's reign and the foundation of his negative reputation in the chronicles. According to the *Tarikh al-Sudan* and *Tarikh al-Fattash*, Sunni Ali punished those scholars who had collaborated with the Tuareg occupation. The qadi (Islamic judge) of Timbuktu was allegedly humiliated; scholars were persecuted, imprisoned, or killed; and the city's learned class suffered under Sunni Ali's wrath.

The chronicles record specific incidents:
- Sunni Ali allegedly ordered the execution of certain scholars for their association with the Tuareg
- He forced some ulama to flee Timbuktu, especially to the city of Walata
- He showed contempt for Islamic learning and learning itself, preferring unlettered warriors
- He allegedly made blasphemous statements about the Prophet and Islamic law [T/D]

**Historiographical Caution:**
These accounts must be treated with extreme care. The chroniclers were scholars or descendants of scholars; Timbuktu's learned class was their community. Sunni Ali had attacked their predecessors, and his successor Askia Muhammad had patronized them — they had every reason to vilify the one and glorify the other.

Modern historians suggest several alternative interpretations:
1. **Political punishment, not religious persecution:** Sunni Ali may have punished scholars who had actively aided the Tuareg, treating them as political collaborators rather than targeting them for their religion
2. **Exaggeration:** The scale and severity of the persecution may have been inflated over generations of chronicle-writing
3. **Class conflict:** The tension may reflect conflict between the military aristocracy (Sunni Ali) and the scholarly elite (the ulama), a pattern common in Islamic history, rather than opposition to Islam per se [D]

What is clear is that the capture of Timbuktu established Sunni Ali's reputation among the ulama as an enemy, a reputation that colors everything else written about him.

### The Siege of Djenne (c. 1468/73-1473/76)

**Background:**
Djenne (also Djenné, Jenne), located in the Inland Niger Delta where the Niger and Bani rivers meet, was one of the wealthiest trading cities in the Western Sudan. Its position made it a natural entrepot for goods moving between the forest zone (gold, kola nuts) and the Sahel and Sahara (salt, cloth). The city was also a significant center of Islamic scholarship, rivaling Timbuktu.

Djenne was famous for its defenses. The *Tarikh al-Sudan* claims that before Sunni Ali, the city had been besieged ninety-nine times without falling. Whether this number is historical or symbolic (ninety-nine being a number of completion in Islamic tradition), Djenne's reputation for impregnability was well established. Its location, surrounded by seasonal floodwaters and approachable only by water during part of the year, made direct assault extremely difficult. [T/P]

**The Campaign:**
The chronology and duration of Sunni Ali's Djenne campaign are uncertain. The traditional account claims a siege lasting seven years, seven months, and seven days — a suspiciously formulaic number. Modern historians suggest the siege may have lasted several years but probably not the full seven. The campaign likely began shortly after the capture of Timbuktu (c. 1468-1469) and concluded around 1473-1476.

Sunni Ali's strategy involved:
- **Blockade:** Cutting Djenne off from external supplies and trade
- **Naval operations:** Using the Songhai river fleet (canoes) to control access to the city during flood season
- **Patience:** Waiting for famine and exhaustion to accomplish what direct assault could not

The *Tarikh al-Sudan* describes the suffering within Djenne as the siege dragged on, with the population reduced to eating animal hides and leaves. [T/P]

**The Surrender:**
Djenne eventually negotiated surrender rather than falling to assault. The terms were remarkably lenient — Sunni Ali is said to have treated the city's population well, married a princess of the ruling family, and incorporated Djenne into the Songhai Empire without the massacre or persecution that might have been expected.

This leniency presents a puzzle given Sunni Ali's reputation for brutality. Possible explanations include:
- **Strategic calculation:** Djenne's commercial value depended on its merchant community and scholarly institutions; destroying them would have been economically foolish
- **Respect for resistance:** Sunni Ali may have admired Djenne's defense and treated honorable surrender differently from collaboration
- **Chronicle bias:** The same sources that exaggerate his brutality elsewhere may understate it at Djenne for reasons unclear [P/D]

The capture of Djenne was strategically crucial. It gave Songhai control over the key node of Niger Delta commerce and completed Sunni Ali's dominance of the Middle Niger.

### Campaigns Against the Mossi

The Mossi kingdoms, located south of the Niger Bend in the savanna woodland (modern Burkina Faso), had been raiding northward for decades, taking advantage of Mali's decline to attack wealthy trading cities. In 1477-1478, Mossi cavalry even raided Walata, deep in the Sahel, demonstrating their reach.

Sunni Ali conducted multiple campaigns against the Mossi throughout his reign. The chronicles record victories, though the Mossi kingdoms were never incorporated into the Songhai Empire — they remained independent polities that Sunni Ali pushed back and punished but did not conquer. The northern Mossi may have become tributaries, but the core Mossi states (Ouagadougou, Yatenga) retained their independence. [P]

The Mossi campaigns demonstrated the limits of even Sunni Ali's military power. The Mossi fought on their own terrain, in conditions less favorable to Songhai cavalry and river-based logistics. Sunni Ali could punish their raids but not eliminate their kingdoms.

### Other Campaigns

The chronicles record numerous other military operations:

- **Against the Tuareg:** After taking Timbuktu, Sunni Ali continued to fight the Tuareg in the desert margins, seeking to protect settled populations from nomadic raiding
- **Against the Fulani:** Pastoral Fulani groups throughout the Niger Bend came into conflict with Songhai expansion; the *Tarikh al-Sudan* records particularly harsh treatment of Fulani communities
- **Against the Dogon:** The Dogon, living in the cliffs of the Bandiagara escarpment, resisted incorporation; Sunni Ali campaigned against them with mixed success
- **Against the remnants of Mali:** Though Mali was in decline, it had not vanished; Songhai pressure further diminished Malian territory during Sunni Ali's reign [P]

### Administration

Sunni Ali is remembered primarily as a warrior, and the chronicles say relatively little about his administrative practices. This may reflect their bias — they were more interested in cataloguing his impieties than his governance — or it may indicate that his administration was indeed rudimentary compared to what his successor Askia Muhammad would build.

What can be inferred:
- **Provincial governors:** Conquered territories were administered through appointed governors, though the degree of centralization is unclear
- **The military aristocracy:** Power rested with the warrior class, with military commanders holding significant authority
- **Continuation of local institutions:** Djenne and probably other conquered cities retained their internal governance structures under Songhai suzerainty
- **The river fleet:** Songhai maintained a significant fleet of war canoes on the Niger, an unusual feature that gave them strategic mobility; the *Tarikh al-Sudan* mentions naval commanders and operations [S/P]

### Religious Policy

The question of Sunni Ali's religious policy is inseparable from the question of his personal religion, discussed below under "Scholarly Debates." What can be said with confidence:

**He was nominally Muslim:** Sunni Ali performed some Islamic observances, at least publicly. The chronicles do not claim he renounced Islam entirely.

**He was not devout by scholarly standards:** The ulama found his Islamic practice inadequate — whether this means he was religiously syncretic, indifferent, or merely insufficiently deferential to scholars.

**He did not pursue Islamization:** Unlike his successor Askia Muhammad, Sunni Ali did not attempt to impose Islamic law uniformly or to extend Islam to non-Muslim populations. His religious policy was permissive or indifferent rather than missionary.

**He persecuted some scholars:** Whatever the reasons — political punishment, personal animosity, or ideological opposition — some members of the Timbuktu ulama suffered under his rule. [E/D]

## The Timbuktu Question: Sunni Ali and the Ulama

The relationship between Sunni Ali and the scholars of Timbuktu requires separate treatment, as it is central to how he has been remembered and how his reign should be understood.

### The Scholars' Grievances

According to the chronicles, Sunni Ali:

1. **Punished scholars who had accepted Tuareg rule:** This could be framed as treason rather than religious persecution
2. **Showed contempt for learning:** He allegedly preferred illiterate warriors and mocked bookish knowledge
3. **Made heterodox religious statements:** The chronicles attribute blasphemous or dismissive remarks about Islam to him
4. **Killed or exiled specific scholars:** Named individuals are said to have died or fled because of him
5. **Preferred indigenous religious practices:** He allegedly performed sacrifices and rituals associated with pre-Islamic Songhai religion

### The Scholars' Position

Timbuktu's ulama were not merely religious leaders; they were a wealthy, influential class with extensive trade connections and significant social power. Their authority rested on their mastery of Islamic law and learning — their ability to legitimate or delegitimate rulers. A ruler who showed them deference acknowledged their importance; a ruler who disregarded them threatened their status.

Sunni Ali represented the warrior tradition — power based on military force rather than religious learning. His conflicts with the ulama may have reflected class conflict as much as religious difference: the military aristocracy versus the scholarly elite.

### The Sources' Bias

The *Tarikh al-Sudan* was written by Abd al-Rahman al-Sadi around 1650, approximately 160 years after Sunni Ali's death. Al-Sadi was a scholar in the Timbuktu tradition, writing to preserve the memory of his city and its learned class. His sources included oral tradition, earlier chronicles (now lost), and the institutional memory of the Timbuktu scholarly families.

The *Tarikh al-Fattash* has a more complex textual history, with sections written by Mahmud Kati (who may have lived during Sunni Ali's time) and later additions by his descendants. It shares the Timbuktu perspective and the negative view of Sunni Ali.

Both chronicles were also written after the Moroccan conquest of 1591, when Timbuktu's scholars had reason to romanticize the Songhai past — but the "good" Songhai, the Askia dynasty that had patronized them, not the "bad" Sonni dynasty that had persecuted them.

### Modern Scholarly Views

Contemporary historians are divided:

**The traditional view** accepts the chronicles' characterization: Sunni Ali was a religiously syncretic ruler whose hostility to Islam and its representatives was genuine and significant.

**The revisionist view** argues that Sunni Ali was a pragmatic ruler whose conflicts with the Timbuktu ulama were primarily political; his "impiety" has been exaggerated by hostile sources.

**The synthetic view** suggests that Sunni Ali probably did practice a form of religious syncretism common among West African rulers — observing Islam publicly while maintaining indigenous practices privately — and that his conflicts with the scholars reflected both religious differences and political tensions, with the chronicles exaggerating the former while obscuring the latter.

## Death and Legacy

### Death (November 1492)

Sunni Ali died in November 1492, returning from a campaign. The circumstances of his death are mysterious. According to the *Tarikh al-Sudan*, he drowned while crossing a body of water — possibly the Niger or a tributary — called Koni. Whether this was an accident, assassination, or something else cannot be determined.

The chronicles treat his death as divine punishment for his impieties, but such interpretations are conventional piety rather than evidence. The timing is suggestive — at the height of his power, suddenly dead — and medieval drownings were sometimes convenient fictions for less natural deaths. [E for the death; D for circumstances]

### The Succession Crisis

Sunni Ali was succeeded by his son, Sunni Baru (also Sunni Baro or Sunni Bakori), who ruled for only a few months. According to the chronicles, Sunni Baru shared his father's religious character, refusing to make the Islamic declaration of faith when challenged.

Muhammad Ture, a general of Soninke origin and a devout Muslim, led a rebellion against Sunni Baru. At the Battle of Anfao in April 1493, Muhammad Ture's forces defeated and killed Sunni Baru, ending the Sonni dynasty. Muhammad Ture became Askia Muhammad I, founder of the Askia dynasty that would rule Songhai until the Moroccan conquest of 1591. [E]

The speed of the dynasty's fall — from the death of the great conqueror to the extinction of his line in mere months — suggests that Sunni Ali's military success had not been matched by institutional stability. His empire was held together by his personal ability; once he was gone, it required refounding by his successor.

### Long-Term Legacy

**The Territorial Foundation:**
Whatever judgment one makes of Sunni Ali's character, his military achievements were permanent. The territory he conquered became the Songhai Empire. The wealth of Timbuktu and Djenne, the control of the Niger, the hegemony over the Middle Niger peoples — all of this passed to the Askia dynasty that displaced him. Askia Muhammad built his sophisticated administration on Sunni Ali's conquests.

**The Scholarly Memory:**
In the Timbuktu tradition, Sunni Ali remained a villain — the tyrant before the good king. This memory, preserved in the chronicles, has dominated historical understanding until recently. Only in modern scholarship has the question of bias been systematically addressed.

**The Popular Memory:**
Among the Songhai people, according to some ethnographic reports, Sunni Ali has been remembered more positively than the chronicles suggest — as a great king who defended his people and extended their power. This alternative memory, transmitted outside the scholarly tradition, hints at how his reign might have been perceived by those who did not suffer his hostility.

**Military Reputation:**
Sunni Ali remains recognized as one of the great military commanders of African history. His campaigns demonstrated strategic vision (the patient siege of Djenne), tactical flexibility (naval and land operations), and the ability to project power across vast distances of difficult terrain. The empire he built was the largest the Western Sudan had yet seen.

## For Fiction Writing

### Dramatic Potential

**Fiction Potential: HIGH**

Sunni Ali offers extraordinary material for fiction — a brilliant, controversial conqueror whose true character is hidden behind hostile sources, leaving space for interpretation. Key dramatic opportunities:

- **The antihero narrative:** A protagonist who achieves great things through ruthless means, forcing readers to confront questions of ends and means
- **The misunderstood ruler:** A revisionist telling that challenges the traditional villain narrative, revealing the political motivations behind his demonization
- **The religious tension:** A ruler caught between traditions — indigenous Songhai religion and imported Islam — in a society being transformed by external cultural forces
- **The conquest narrative:** Military campaigns that would make any epic fantasy writer envious — the liberation of Timbuktu, the seven-year siege, the desert and river warfare

**Internal Conflict:**
- Negotiating between his indigenous heritage (mother's people) and the Islamic culture of the urban elite
- The relationship between military power and cultural legitimacy
- Whether to accommodate the scholars who despise him or crush them
- Building an empire that may not survive him

**Moral Complexity:**
Sunni Ali defies simple categorization. He persecuted scholars but treated Djenne with mercy. He was nominally Muslim but practiced (allegedly) indigenous religion. He built an empire but failed to create stable succession. A fiction writer can lean into this complexity rather than resolving it.

### Sensory World

**Landscape:**
- The Niger River: wide, brown, slow-moving through the dry season; swelling and flooding in the rains; the lifeline of the empire
- Timbuktu: mud-brick city at the edge of the Sahara, where camel caravans meet river boats; narrow streets, sand-colored walls, the great mosques rising above
- Djenne: island city in the seasonal floodwaters, approached by canoe during high water; its famous mosque dominating the skyline
- Gao: the Songhai capital, stretched along the riverbank; royal compounds, markets, the tombs of ancient rulers
- The desert margins: sandy plains, Tuareg encampments, the shimmer of heat
- The southern campaigns: wooded savanna, the Dogon cliffs rising dramatically from the plain

**Climate and Weather:**
- The Sahel seasons: the dry harmattan (November-February) bringing dust from the Sahara; the building heat before the rains (March-May); the wet season (June-October) when the Niger floods
- Desert campaigning: the crushing heat, the need for water discipline, the relief of oases
- River campaigning: the coolness on the water, the mosquitoes, the strategic timing around flood and drought

**Sounds:**
- The drums of war: communication across distances, the signal to attack, the celebration of victory
- The call to prayer: echoing from Timbuktu's mosques, a reminder of the faith Sunni Ali allegedly betrayed
- River sounds: the splash of paddles, the creak of canoes, the fishermen's songs
- The court: griots praising (or warning), advisors debating, the clatter of weapons
- Cavalry: the thunder of hooves, the whinny of horses, the cries of riders

**Visual Details:**
- Sunni Ali's appearance: Never described in the sources, leaving freedom for the writer. A warrior-king's clothing might include quilted cotton armor, leather riding gear, weapons both functional and ceremonial
- The Songhai fleet: war canoes carved from massive tree trunks, carrying archers and infantry
- Timbuktu's architecture: the distinctive mud-brick style with wooden beams protruding, flat roofs, narrow alleys
- The scholars: white robes, turbans, prayer beads, the trappings of learning
- The Tuareg: veiled desert warriors, riding camels, draped in indigo-dyed cloth that stained their skin blue

**Taste and Smell:**
- Campaign food: millet porridge, dried fish, dates carried from the Sahara
- River fish: fresh, smoked, dried — the protein of the Niger
- Timbuktu's markets: the smell of leather being worked, spices from across the Sahara, the dust of salt blocks
- Blood and smoke: the aftermath of battle, the smell that follows victory
- Incense: burned in religious ceremonies, both Islamic and indigenous

**Materials and Textures:**
- Cotton: the woven strips of local cloth, indigo-dyed or undyed
- Leather: Saharan craftsmanship in saddles, sandals, amulet cases
- Iron: Songhai weapons, horse equipment, the tools of the forge
- Gold: dust measured by weight, ornaments worn by the powerful
- Salt: the rock-hard slabs from Taghaza, worth their weight in gold

### Speech and Voice

**Modes of Address:**
- **Sunni/Sonni:** The dynastic title, used like "Mansa" in Mali — "Sunni Ali" rather than just "Ali"
- **Ber:** "The Great" in Songhai; a praise name indicating his achievements
- **Dali:** Possibly a title used for the ruler, though the exact protocol is unclear
- **The scholars' titles:** Qadi (judge), alfa (scholar), imam — terms of respect for the learned

**Rhetorical Style:**
- **A warrior's bluntness:** If the chronicles are any guide, Sunni Ali was not a polished speaker; he allegedly mocked bookish eloquence
- **Commands:** Military speech is direct; battle orders must be clear
- **Challenges:** The verbal dimension of warfare — threatening, boasting, demanding surrender
- **Contempt for enemies:** The chronicles preserve alleged insults against scholars; whether historical or not, they suggest a style of aggressive rhetoric

**Dialogue Opportunities:**
- The demand for Timbuktu's surrender
- Confrontations with scholars who challenge his religious practice
- War councils with his generals
- The moment of Djenne's capitulation — terms of surrender
- Possible deathbed scene (if not accidental drowning)
- Conversations with his son Sunni Baru about succession and the future

### Key Relationships

**The Timbuktu Ulama (Collective Antagonists):**
Not a single figure but a class — the scholars Sunni Ali allegedly persecuted. Writing this relationship:
- The power dynamic: he has military power; they have cultural authority
- The specific individuals: the qadi he humiliated, the scholars he killed or exiled
- The underground resistance: scholars who survived and waited for a more sympathetic ruler
- The ideological dimension: what they represent (Islam, learning, civilization) versus what he represents (military power, indigenous tradition)

**Muhammad Ture (Future Askia Muhammad):**
During Sunni Ali's reign, the general who would overthrow his son served in his army. The relationship between them could be fertile ground:
- Was Muhammad Ture a loyal general who only rebelled after Sunni Baru's succession?
- Or was there tension even during Sunni Ali's lifetime?
- The contrast between them: the devout Muslim general and the syncretic king
- If Sunni Ali suspected Muhammad Ture's ambitions, what passed between them?

**Sunni Baru (Son and Heir):**
The son who would lose everything. Writing this relationship:
- Did Sunni Ali prepare his son for rule?
- Did Sunni Baru share his father's religious attitudes, or was he his own man?
- The pressure of being heir to a legend
- The tragic arc: inheriting an empire and losing it in months

**The Tuareg (Akil Ag-Amalwal):**
The Tuareg chief whom Sunni Ali expelled from Timbuktu. Possible scenes:
- The confrontation that ended Tuareg rule
- Ongoing Tuareg resistance in the desert
- The contrast between nomadic and sedentary power

**Djenne's Rulers:**
The besieged city's leadership. Writing this relationship:
- Years of siege create a peculiar intimacy between besieger and besieged
- The negotiation of surrender
- Sunni Ali's marriage alliance with Djenne's ruling family
- The respect between worthy adversaries

### Scene Opportunities

**The Entry into Timbuktu (1468):**
The moment of conquest. Scene elements:
- The Tuareg fleeing before Songhai forces
- The city's population uncertain whether this is liberation or new oppression
- The scholars who had invited him now facing his wrath
- The first clash between conqueror and ulama

**The Persecution:**
A difficult but dramatically rich scene. Elements:
- A specific scholar facing Sunni Ali's judgment
- The charge: collaboration with the Tuareg
- The execution or exile
- Witnesses who will remember and record
- The moral ambiguity: was this justice for treason or persecution of faith?

**The Siege of Djenne:**
Multiple scenes over the siege years:
- The encirclement: Songhai forces establishing the blockade
- The river war: canoe battles for control of approaches
- Inside the besieged city: hunger, desperation, the debate over surrender
- The breakthrough: the moment Djenne decides to negotiate
- The surrender ceremony: Sunni Ali receiving the city's submission

**The Mossi Campaign:**
Desert and savanna warfare:
- Cavalry operations in unfamiliar terrain
- The frustration of an enemy who will not stand and fight
- The limits of Songhai power
- The return home, victorious but incomplete

**The Return to Gao:**
The conqueror in his capital:
- The court: griots praising his deeds, generals reporting, wealth flowing in
- The tension with religious authorities
- The family: his son Sunni Baru, the succession question
- The isolation of power: who can he trust?

**The Final Campaign and Death:**
The mystery of his end:
- The campaign against [specific enemies] — one more military operation
- The crossing of Koni — the fatal river
- The drowning: accident, assassination, or something else?
- The body recovered (or not); the news reaching Gao
- The succession crisis beginning

### Worldview and Values

**Military Virtue:**
Sunni Ali valued martial excellence above all else. Writing in his worldview:
- Victory is the ultimate measure of worth
- Courage and skill at arms command respect
- Learning without power is contemptible
- The warrior's code: certain behaviors are honorable, others are not

**Pragmatic Religiosity:**
Whether Sunni Ali was secretly devoted to indigenous religion, genuinely syncretic, or simply indifferent, his religious worldview was functional rather than devout:
- Religion serves the state, not the reverse
- Multiple religious traditions can coexist
- Scholars who claim authority over rulers are threats
- Spiritual power is real but should serve practical ends

**Imperial Vision:**
Sunni Ali was building something — an empire. His worldview included:
- The Songhai people deserve to rule
- Conquest brings wealth and security
- Subject peoples should submit; resistance will be crushed
- The Niger is the axis of power

**Distrust of the Scholarly Class:**
Whether rooted in religious difference, class conflict, or personal experience, Sunni Ali's suspicion of scholars was a defining attitude:
- They serve their own interests, not the state's
- Their learning makes them arrogant
- They collaborated with the enemy (Tuareg)
- Their authority threatens the ruler's power

## Sources

### Primary Sources

**Tarikh al-Sudan (Abd al-Rahman al-Sadi, c. 1650):**
The most important source for Sunni Ali's reign. Written approximately 160 years after his death, it draws on oral tradition, earlier chronicles (now lost), and the institutional memory of Timbuktu's scholarly families. Al-Sadi's account is detailed, providing specific events, dates, and characterizations — but his perspective is that of the scholars whom Sunni Ali persecuted, and his work was commissioned under the Askia-era tradition that celebrated Askia Muhammad as the good ruler who followed the bad.

**Translation:** John Hunwick, *Timbuktu and the Songhay Empire: Al-Sa'di's Ta'rikh al-Sudan down to 1613, and Other Contemporary Documents* (Brill, 1999). This is the standard scholarly translation and includes extensive notes. [E — essential primary source]

**Tarikh al-Fattash (Mahmud Kati family, c. 1519-1665):**
A more complex textual situation. Parts may have been written by Mahmud Kati, who lived during the late Sonni and early Askia periods, but the work was compiled and extended by his descendants over generations. It shares the Timbuktu perspective and the negative view of Sunni Ali. Some scholars have questioned the authenticity of certain passages, suggesting later interpolation.

**Translation:** Older French translations exist; no complete modern English translation is available, though excerpts appear in various scholarly works. [E — important primary source with textual complexities]

### Secondary Sources

**Hunwick, John O., *Timbuktu and the Songhay Empire*** (1999):
Includes the *Tarikh al-Sudan* translation plus extensive historical analysis. Hunwick's introduction and notes provide the most authoritative scholarly treatment of Songhai history in English. Essential for serious research.

**Gomez, Michael A., *African Dominion: A New History of Empire in Early and Medieval West Africa*** (2018):
The most recent major synthesis of West African imperial history. Gomez provides fresh analysis of Sunni Ali and the Songhai Empire, engaging with the historiographical debates about source bias and religious characterization. Centers African perspectives and challenges earlier Eurocentric assumptions.

**Cissoko, Sekene Mody, *Tombouctou et l'Empire Songhay*** (1975):
French-language study providing a Malian scholarly perspective. Important for understanding how Sunni Ali is viewed from within the region.

**Levtzion, Nehemia, *Ancient Ghana and Mali*** (1973):
Though focused on the earlier empires, Levtzion provides essential context for understanding the world Sunni Ali inherited and transformed.

**Saad, Elias N., *Social History of Timbuktu*** (1983):
Valuable for understanding the scholarly class that Sunni Ali clashed with — their social position, their institutions, their worldview.

### Source Assessment

The evidence for Sunni Ali is paradoxical: relatively abundant in detail but entirely filtered through hostile witnesses. We know more about his reign than many medieval African rulers, but everything we know comes from sources with reason to vilify him.

**What is well-established [E]:**
- His existence and reign (1464-1492)
- The capture of Timbuktu (1468) and Djenne (c. 1473)
- Major military campaigns and their outcomes
- His death in 1492 and succession by Sunni Baru
- The overthrow of the Sonni dynasty by Muhammad Ture (1493)

**What is probable [P]:**
- The general characterization of his reign as militarily successful
- Some degree of conflict with the Timbuktu ulama
- Religious practices that did not meet scholarly standards

**What is debated [D]:**
- The scale and nature of the persecution of scholars
- His personal religious beliefs and practices
- The circumstances of his death
- Whether the hostile characterization is substantially accurate or propagandistic

**What is speculative or legendary [S/T]:**
- Specific speeches and statements attributed to him
- Details that fit too neatly into religious narratives (prophecies, divine punishment)
- Numbers (seven-year siege, ninety-nine previous sieges)

For fiction purposes, the uncertainty is liberating. A writer can interpret Sunni Ali as villain, antihero, or misunderstood ruler, and find support for any interpretation in the gaps the sources leave.
