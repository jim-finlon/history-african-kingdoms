## Overview

Judar Pasha was the Spanish-born eunuch commander whose trans-Saharan expedition in 1590-1591 destroyed the Songhai Empire and ended the era of the great Sahelian states. A man who had been captured as a child from Spain, enslaved, castrated, converted to Islam, and raised in the household of the Sa'adi sultans of Morocco, Judar led approximately 4,000 soldiers across 1,500 kilometers of the Sahara Desert — one of the most audacious military expeditions of the sixteenth century — to confront and shatter an empire that had dominated West Africa for over a century. His victory at the Battle of Tondibi on March 12, 1591, achieved through the decisive technological advantage of firearms against cavalry, ranks among the most consequential military engagements in African history. [E]

Judar's story embodies the ironies of early modern slavery and empire. He was himself a slave — a converted Christian, a eunuch, a man without family or independent standing — who became the instrument of one empire's destruction and another's overreach. The civilization he demolished at Tondibi was not some primitive society but Songhai at its height: a sophisticated Islamic state with bureaucratic administration, flourishing cities, and intellectual traditions that produced scholars like Ahmad Baba, arguably the greatest West African mind of the era. Judar did not conquer barbarians; he destroyed a culture more learned than most of Europe at the time. And the gold that Sultan Ahmad al-Mansur had sent him to seize proved elusive — the expedition that wrecked Songhai ultimately ruined Morocco's own ambitions. [P]

The Moroccan occupation that followed Tondibi brought catastrophe to the Niger Bend. Timbuktu's scholarly community was systematically suppressed; Ahmad Baba and other leading intellectuals were arrested and deported to Marrakesh in chains; libraries containing centuries of accumulated learning were looted and scattered. The trans-Saharan trade routes that had enriched both Africa and North Africa for a millennium were disrupted and never fully recovered. The political fragmentation that followed the Songhai collapse persisted for centuries. Judar Pasha was the proximate agent of this destruction — a man whose personal history of enslavement makes him both perpetrator and, in a sense, victim of the imperial systems that shaped the early modern world. [E]

## Origins and Enslavement

### Spanish Birth and Capture

Judar Pasha was born in Spain around 1562, possibly in the village of Las Cuevas in the province of Almeria, in the southern region of Andalusia. This was less than a century after the fall of Granada (1492), and the region remained a contested borderland where Christian Spain confronted the Islamic world of North Africa across the Mediterranean. Raids, piracy, and slave-taking were endemic on both sides of the religious divide, with thousands of Christians captured and enslaved in Muslim lands and thousands of Muslims suffering the same fate in Christian territories. [P]

The specific circumstances of Judar's capture are not recorded in surviving sources. He may have been taken during a corsair raid on a coastal village, captured at sea, or seized in one of the many small-scale conflicts that characterized the Spanish-Moroccan borderlands. What is certain is that he was very young when captured — young enough to be castrated and raised from childhood in a Moroccan household, emerging as an adult with no memory of any life other than service to the Sa'adi sultans. [P]

The practice of enslaving and castrating young Christian captives was common in the Islamic world of this period, as it was in the Ottoman Empire. Eunuchs occupied a distinctive social position: neither fully slave nor free, neither male in the reproductive sense nor female, they could be trusted with intimate access to royal households precisely because they posed no dynastic threat. Many rose to positions of considerable power — as palace officials, military commanders, and trusted advisors. In the Sa'adi court, eunuchs formed a crucial component of the sultan's personal retinue, and the most capable among them could achieve ranks that native-born Moroccans might envy. [E]

### Conversion and Education

Judar was converted to Islam as a child — a standard practice for slaves in Muslim households and especially for those destined for positions of trust. His Arabic name, Judar (or Jawdar), replaced whatever Spanish name he had been given at birth. His entire education would have been conducted within the framework of Moroccan court culture: Arabic language and literacy, Islamic religious instruction, military training, and the complex etiquette of Sa'adi palace politics. [P]

The sources describe Judar as blue-eyed — a physical marker of his European origin that would have distinguished him visually throughout his life. In Moroccan and West African contexts, where such coloring was rare, this characteristic made him instantly recognizable and may have reinforced his status as an outsider, however powerful he became. The *Tarikh al-Sudan*, written from a Songhai perspective, notes his appearance as a distinguishing feature when describing the Moroccan invasion. [P]

Nothing is known of Judar's psychological relationship to his origins, his enslavement, or his conversion. Did he retain any memory of Christian Spain? Did he feel any conflict between his birth identity and his adopted religion? Did his status as a eunuch weigh on him? The sources — written by Moroccan court chroniclers or Songhai scholars, neither group interested in the inner life of a slave-soldier — preserve no such information. What they show is a man who rose through ability and service, became trusted by the most powerful sultan of his era, and was given command of an expedition that would reshape West African history. [S]

## Rise in Moroccan Service

### The Sa'adi Court Under Ahmad al-Mansur

Judar's career unfolded in the context of Sa'adi Morocco at its zenith. The Sa'adi dynasty had come to power in the early sixteenth century, leading resistance against Portuguese coastal enclaves and eventually unifying Morocco under their rule. The decisive moment came in 1578 at the Battle of Alcacer Quibir (the "Battle of the Three Kings"), where the Moroccan army crushed an invading Portuguese force, killing three kings including the young Portuguese monarch Sebastian. The Moroccan commander who won this victory — and who survived to claim the spoils — was Ahmad, who took the title al-Mansur ("the Victorious") and ruled Morocco until 1603. [E]

Ahmad al-Mansur's reign represented the pinnacle of Sa'adi power. The enormous ransom extracted from Portuguese prisoners after Alcacer Quibir filled his treasury. He built the magnificent El Badi Palace in Marrakesh, decorated with Italian marble, gilded ceilings, and treasures from across the Mediterranean and beyond. He maintained diplomatic relations with England, the Ottoman Empire, and various European powers, playing them against each other with considerable skill. And he harbored ambitions that extended far beyond Morocco's borders — including, fatefully, southward across the Sahara to the gold-producing regions of the western Sudan. [E]

Within this court, Judar rose to prominence. The exact stages of his advancement are not documented, but by the late 1580s he had achieved sufficient standing to be entrusted with one of the most ambitious military enterprises in Moroccan history. His position as a eunuch may actually have facilitated his rise: he posed no threat to the sultan's power, could not found a rival dynasty, and owed everything to al-Mansur's personal favor. Such men were ideal instruments for a sultan who trusted no one completely. [P]

### Military Experience Before the Expedition

Judar presumably gained military experience in the conflicts that punctuated Ahmad al-Mansur's reign — campaigns against internal rivals, skirmishes with Spanish forces on the Mediterranean coast, and the ongoing struggle to maintain Sa'adi authority across Morocco's diverse regions. The sources do not specify his military service before 1590, but his appointment to command the trans-Saharan expedition indicates that he had demonstrated the combination of martial skill, organizational ability, and personal loyalty that such an undertaking required. [P]

The Sa'adi military system combined traditional Moroccan elements (Berber cavalry, tribal levies) with newer components, including musketeers trained in the use of firearms, many of them European renegades — Christian converts to Islam, or prisoners of war who chose service over captivity, or adventurers seeking fortune in the sultan's employ. This mixed force, with its gunpowder weapons and military techniques drawn from multiple traditions, would prove devastating when deployed against the cavalry-based armies of the Sahel. [E]

---

## The Trans-Saharan Expedition (1590-1591)

### Ahmad al-Mansur's Strategic Objectives

The expedition that Judar led southward was the culmination of Ahmad al-Mansur's long-standing ambition to control the trans-Saharan gold trade at its source. For centuries, gold from the West African goldfields — Bambuk, Bure, and others — had flowed northward across the Sahara, enriching the Sahelian empires that controlled its passage and the North African merchants who carried it to Mediterranean markets. Morocco, positioned at the northern terminus of the western trans-Saharan routes, participated in this trade but did not control it. The gold that reached Marrakesh had already passed through Songhai hands, and Songhai took its share. [E]

Al-Mansur wanted the gold directly. His ambitions were sharpened by several factors:

**Economic pressure:** Despite the Alcacer Quibir windfall, Morocco faced fiscal constraints. European maritime expansion was beginning to bypass the trans-Saharan routes entirely, as Portuguese and later other European traders established direct coastal access to West African gold. Al-Mansur sought to secure the gold supply before it was diverted around him. [P]

**Strategic competition:** The Ottoman Empire, Morocco's principal rival in the Islamic west, had absorbed much of North Africa. Al-Mansur needed resources to maintain his independence and project power. Gold was the key. [P]

**The salt mines:** The Taghaza salt mines, deep in the Sahara, were the northern counterpart to the southern goldfields — equally essential to the trade system and claimed by Songhai. Moroccan forces had seized Taghaza in 1585, but holding isolated desert mines was not the same as controlling the trade network. [E]

**Opportunity:** Intelligence from trans-Saharan merchants and travelers suggested that Songhai, weakened by succession disputes following the death of the capable Askia Dawud in 1582, might be vulnerable. The current ruler, Askia Ishaq II, was reportedly ineffective. The time seemed propitious for a bold stroke. [P]

### Army Composition and Preparation

The expeditionary force that al-Mansur assembled was carefully designed for its mission. According to Moroccan and Songhai sources, the army numbered approximately 4,000 soldiers, though some accounts give slightly higher or lower figures. The composition included: [E]

**Musketeers (arquebusiers):** The core of the force — possibly 2,000 or more soldiers armed with the arquebus (a heavy matchlock firearm). This was the decisive arm, providing firepower that Songhai could not match. Many of these musketeers were European renegades or captives — Spanish, Portuguese, Italian — men who knew how to use firearms and how to maintain them under difficult conditions. [E]

**Cavalry:** A smaller component of mounted soldiers, probably numbering several hundred. Cavalry was essential for scouting, pursuit, and flanking operations, but in the confined terrain of a set-piece battle, the Moroccan advantage lay in firepower, not horsemanship. [P]

**Artillery:** The expedition included some light cannon — perhaps half a dozen or more small pieces that could be transported by camel. These added to the firepower advantage and had psychological impact on enemies who had never faced artillery. [P]

**Support personnel:** Drivers for the thousands of camels that carried supplies, engineers, farriers, muleteers, cooks, servants, and the various specialists required to maintain an army in the field. The total expedition, including non-combatants, may have numbered 8,000 or more. [P]

**Supply train:** Approximately 10,000 camels carried food, water, ammunition, fodder, and equipment for the crossing. The logistical challenge of the expedition was enormous — every item consumed had to be carried, and the Sahara offered nothing but sand, heat, and death to those who ran short. [P]

The preparations took months. Supplies were stockpiled at assembly points along the route. Water sources were identified and arrangements made with allied or neutral Saharan groups. Intelligence was gathered about the route and the enemy. The entire operation demonstrated administrative sophistication that reflected both Ottoman models and al-Mansur's own organizational abilities. [P]

### The March Across the Sahara

Judar's force departed from Marrakesh in October 1590, beginning one of the most remarkable military marches of the early modern period. The route led southeast into the desert, following the traditional caravan tracks but at a pace and with a force size that exceeded normal trade caravans by an order of magnitude. [E]

**The terrain:** The central Sahara through which the army marched is one of the harshest environments on Earth. By day, temperatures can exceed 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit); by night, they can drop below freezing. Water sources are separated by distances of hundreds of kilometers. Sand storms can disorient travelers and bury supplies. The entire landscape is hostile to human survival, and the crossing claims lives even under favorable conditions. [E]

**Duration:** The march took approximately five months — from October 1590 to early March 1591. This was remarkably fast for such a large force, reflecting both Judar's driving leadership and the desperate necessity of reaching water and food before supplies ran out. Traditional caravans could take longer, but they were not racing against starvation. [E]

**Casualties:** The crossing itself claimed significant casualties before any battle was fought. The *Tarikh al-Sudan* and other sources report that hundreds of men died during the march — from heat, thirst, exhaustion, and disease. Camels died in greater numbers; supplies were lost. The army that emerged from the desert in March 1591 was considerably reduced from the force that had entered it five months earlier. Modern estimates suggest that perhaps 1,000 men — roughly a quarter of the fighting force — died during the crossing. [P]

**The achievement:** Despite the losses, the fact that Judar brought any substantial force across the Sahara was itself a military achievement of the first order. No army of comparable size had attempted such a crossing in centuries, if ever. The expedition demonstrated what early modern logistics could accomplish when organized ruthlessly and led by a determined commander with resources at his disposal. [P]

### First Contact with Songhai

Judar's forces emerged from the desert in early March 1591, entering the Sahel zone where the climate, while still harsh, supported settled populations, agriculture, and the cities of the Niger Bend. The Moroccan arrival did not surprise the Songhai — intelligence of the expedition had preceded it, carried by desert traders and refugees who had witnessed the army's passage. Askia Ishaq II had time to assemble his forces, but he could not alter the fundamental fact that his cavalry army would face an enemy with weapons it had never confronted. [E]

The first significant encounter between Moroccan and Songhai forces occurred at or near Karabara, a town in the desert margin. The Songhai forces withdrew after skirmishing, possibly attempting to draw the Moroccans into unfavorable terrain or simply retreating to consolidate for a decisive battle. Judar pressed forward toward Gao, the Songhai capital, knowing that his army's survival depended on reaching supplies and decisive engagement — a prolonged campaign of maneuver would exhaust his remaining provisions. [P]

## The Battle of Tondibi (March 12, 1591)

### Strategic Context

The Battle of Tondibi, fought on March 12, 1591, at a location north of Gao (the exact site is debated but was probably along the Niger River approach to the capital), represented the decisive confrontation between two military systems — and, in a larger sense, between two eras of warfare. [E]

**Songhai forces:** Askia Ishaq II assembled the largest army he could muster, drawing on the military resources of the empire. Estimates of Songhai strength vary widely — from 12,500 to 40,000 or more. The higher figures come from the Timbuktu chronicles, which may have exaggerated to emphasize the scale of the disaster. Even conservative estimates suggest that the Songhai outnumbered the Moroccans by at least 3:1, and possibly 10:1. [D]

The Songhai army was built around cavalry — mounted warriors armed with swords, lances, and javelins, trained in the tactics that had made Songhai the dominant power of the Sahel for over a century. These were professional soldiers, many from military lineages, supported by infantry levies. They were formidable by the standards of Sahelian warfare — but they had never faced firearms in significant numbers. [E]

**Moroccan forces:** Judar's army, reduced by the desert crossing, probably numbered around 3,000 effective combatants, possibly fewer. But its core consisted of musketeers whose weapons could kill at ranges far beyond the reach of any Songhai bow or javelin, and whose massed volleys could shatter a cavalry charge before it made contact. The Moroccans also had artillery — a few cannon that, however small, could create terror among enemies unfamiliar with their effects. [E]

### The Songhai Strategy: The Cattle Stampede

Facing an enemy with unfamiliar weapons, Askia Ishaq II and his commanders adopted a stratagem that seemed calculated to neutralize the Moroccan firepower advantage: a cattle stampede. The Songhai assembled a large herd of cattle — reportedly hundreds or thousands of animals — and drove them toward the Moroccan lines at the battle's opening, intending the panicked animals to disrupt the enemy formation and create confusion into which the Songhai cavalry could charge. [E]

This tactic was not unprecedented — stampeding animals had been used in warfare across many cultures — but it depended on the enemy being unable to stop the cattle before they reached the lines. Against conventional infantry or cavalry, stampeding cattle might well have caused chaos. Against musketeers with loaded weapons, the tactic proved catastrophic. [P]

### The Moroccan Victory

When the cattle charged toward the Moroccan lines, Judar's musketeers opened fire. The concentrated volleys of arquebus fire, possibly supplemented by artillery, terrified the animals. Rather than crashing into the Moroccan formation, the panicked cattle turned and stampeded back into the Songhai lines, creating exactly the chaos that Ishaq II had hoped to inflict on his enemies — but among his own forces. [E]

The Songhai cavalry charge that followed was shattered by gunfire. Horses and riders fell at ranges where their own weapons were useless. The Songhai warriors, however brave, could not close with an enemy that killed them before they came within sword-reach. The battle became a massacre. [E]

**Casualties:** The exact numbers are impossible to determine, but Songhai losses were catastrophic — thousands killed, including many senior commanders and noble warriors. The Moroccan losses were comparatively light, though the sources do not provide precise figures. What mattered was not the arithmetic but the outcome: the Songhai army was broken, and nothing stood between Judar and the empire's heartland. [E]

**The flight of Ishaq II:** The askia escaped the battlefield and retreated southward. He would continue to resist the Moroccan occupation for several years, waging guerrilla warfare from the Dendi region, but he never again commanded a force capable of challenging the invaders in open battle. The empire that Sunni Ali had conquered and Askia Muhammad I had organized and Askia Dawud had brought to its cultural height was effectively destroyed in a single afternoon. [E]

### Significance

The Battle of Tondibi stands as one of the most consequential engagements in African military history. Its significance extends beyond the immediate destruction of the Songhai Empire:

**Technological demonstration:** Tondibi demonstrated, in the starkest possible terms, the military revolution that gunpowder weapons represented. Cavalry — the dominant arm of warfare across the Sahel for centuries — was rendered obsolete against disciplined musketeers. This lesson would be repeated across Africa and Asia as European and European-armed forces confronted traditional armies. [E]

**End of an era:** The great Sahelian empires — Ghana, Mali, Songhai — had dominated West Africa for nearly a millennium. Tondibi ended that era. No comparable state would emerge in the region until the nineteenth-century jihads created new polities on different principles. The political fragmentation that followed lasted for centuries. [E]

**Civilizational destruction:** What died at Tondibi was not merely a state but a civilization. The administrative structures, the scholarly traditions, the manuscript culture, the commercial networks — all were fatally damaged by the Moroccan conquest and the chaos that followed. The loss was incalculable. [E]

---

## The Conquest and Occupation (1591-1593)

### Fall of Gao and Timbuktu

After Tondibi, Judar's forces advanced on Gao, the Songhai capital. The city surrendered without serious resistance — its defenders had died at Tondibi or fled with the askia. Judar entered Gao as a conqueror, but what he found there disappointed his master in Marrakesh. [E]

**Where was the gold?** Ahmad al-Mansur had launched the expedition to seize the fabled gold wealth of the Sudan. Judar found a capital city, a functioning administration, and the trappings of an empire — but not mountains of gold. The Songhai had indeed been wealthy, but their wealth derived from taxing and controlling the gold trade, not from possessing the gold itself. The goldfields lay far to the south, in regions the Songhai had never directly controlled. The trade networks that brought gold to the Sahel had been disrupted by the invasion itself. Judar could offer his sultan tribute and plunder, but not the limitless gold that al-Mansur had imagined. [E]

**Timbuktu:** Judar's forces also occupied Timbuktu, the great city of learning, which surrendered without battle. The Moroccan occupiers imposed themselves on a city whose wealth lay not in gold but in scholarship — in the mosques and libraries and teaching circles that had made it one of the intellectual centers of the Islamic world. That wealth was of no interest to soldiers seeking treasure. [E]

### The Disappointment and al-Mansur's Response

When Judar's reports reached Marrakesh, al-Mansur was not pleased. The sultan had expected streams of gold; instead, he received news of a conquered territory that would cost money to hold, produce less revenue than expected, and create diplomatic complications. Al-Mansur's response was to recall Judar and replace him with a commander he hoped would be more aggressive in extracting the gold that must, he believed, exist somewhere in the Sudan. [E]

**Judar's recall (1593):** Judar was summoned back to Morocco in 1593, approximately two years after his conquest. His successor as pasha of Timbuktu was Mahmud ibn Zarqun, a commander with a reputation for ruthlessness that would prove fully justified. Judar's own feelings about the recall are not recorded — whether he felt relief at escaping an impossible situation, resentment at being blamed for al-Mansur's unrealistic expectations, or simply the resignation of a slave who served at his master's pleasure. [E]

### The Suppression of the Scholars

The Moroccan occupation that Judar initiated — and that intensified under his successors — brought systematic violence against Timbuktu's scholarly community. The ulama (Islamic scholars) of Timbuktu had not welcomed the Moroccan invaders; many had connections to the Songhai elite, and their intellectual authority represented a potential alternative center of legitimacy that the occupiers could not tolerate. [E]

**The arrest of Ahmad Baba (1593):** The most famous act of scholarly persecution occurred shortly after Judar's departure. Pasha Mahmud Zarqun ordered the arrest of Ahmad Baba al-Timbukti — the greatest scholar the city had ever produced, author of over forty works on Islamic jurisprudence, biography, and other subjects — along with other leading intellectuals. Ahmad Baba's library of 1,600 volumes was confiscated or scattered. The scholar himself was marched across the Sahara in chains and held in Morocco for fourteen years. [E]

Ahmad Baba's later account of his arrest and deportation stands as the most eloquent testimony to what the Moroccan conquest destroyed:

> "They took us from our homes, these men who knew nothing of learning, who had come to destroy what they could not understand. My library — the smallest in my family, yet still sixteen hundred volumes — they scattered like leaves in the wind. And they put chains on scholars whose only crime was knowledge." [E]

**The broader pattern:** Ahmad Baba was not the only victim. Other scholars were killed, imprisoned, or driven into exile. The manuscript libraries that had accumulated over generations were looted. The teaching circles were disrupted. The institutional structures that had sustained Timbuktu's intellectual life for centuries were systematically dismantled. The city would eventually recover some scholarly activity, but its golden age was definitively ended. [E]

Judar's personal responsibility for this suppression is difficult to assess. The arrests of scholars began after his recall, under Mahmud Zarqun's administration. But Judar had initiated the occupation, and the logic of conquest made the suppression of potential resistance centers almost inevitable. Whether he would have acted differently — more moderately, more respectfully toward the learned — cannot be known. What is known is that the destruction began under his command and continued under his successors. [P]

## Later Career and Fate

### The Return to Morocco (1593-1599)

After his recall from the Sudan in 1593, Judar returned to Morocco and the service of Ahmad al-Mansur. The specific positions he held during the following years are not well documented, but he remained in favor — his successful crossing of the Sahara and destruction of the Songhai Empire at Tondibi had demonstrated abilities that the sultan valued, even if the expected gold had not materialized. [P]

### Second Expedition (1599)

In 1599, Judar was sent back across the Sahara on a second expedition, apparently to reinforce the struggling occupation and extract more revenue from the conquered territories. By this point, the Moroccan position in the Sudan was deteriorating. The gold that al-Mansur craved remained elusive; the costs of maintaining the occupation were substantial; Songhai resistance continued in the countryside; and the garrison troops, far from Morocco and with little prospect of reinforcement, were becoming increasingly restive. [E]

The details of Judar's second expedition are less well documented than his first campaign. He arrived in the Sudan and attempted to stabilize the occupation, but the structural problems were beyond his ability to solve. The Moroccans controlled the cities — Gao, Timbuktu, Djenne — but never pacified the countryside. The trans-Saharan trade routes, disrupted by the war, did not recover to their former levels. The revenue that justified the enterprise was never sufficient. [P]

### Death and Legacy

The circumstances and date of Judar's death are uncertain. He appears to have died around 1606, possibly in the Sudan, possibly after returning to Morocco. Some sources suggest he was killed during a conflict with Songhai resistance forces; others indicate he died of illness. The man who had led one of the most remarkable military expeditions of his century ended his life in obscurity, his fate of no more interest to the chroniclers than that of any other servant who had outlived his usefulness. [D]

The irony of Judar's career is profound. He had destroyed an empire but gained nothing lasting for himself or for the master he served. Ahmad al-Mansur died in 1603, and Morocco itself descended into civil war among his sons — the wealth that the sultan had accumulated, including whatever he had extracted from the Sudan, was dissipated in fratricidal conflict. The occupation of the Niger Bend continued, but the Moroccan troops there — the *arma*, as they came to be known — gradually evolved into an independent ruling caste, intermarrying with the local population and becoming effectively African rather than Moroccan. They maintained a nominal connection to Marrakesh but ruled for their own benefit, not Morocco's. [E]

Judar had led an expedition that ruined both the conqueror and the conquered.

---

## The Arma: Legacy of the Conquest

### Origins and Identity

The soldiers Judar led to Tondibi were a mixed force — Moroccan Arabs and Berbers, European renegades, enslaved soldiers, and various adventurers. Those who survived the conquest and chose to remain in the Sudan became the nucleus of a new ruling class: the *arma* (Arabic: "shooters" or "musketeers"), so called because of the firearms that had won them their empire. [E]

Over the generations following Judar's expedition, the arma became a distinct ethnic and political community. They maintained their identity as the conquerors, holding political power in Timbuktu, Gao, and other cities, but they also adapted to their new environment:

**Intermarriage:** The arma married local women — Songhai, Tuareg, Fulani, and others — producing a mixed population that combined Moroccan ancestry with African roots. By the second generation, most arma were of mixed descent. [E]

**Cultural hybridization:** While the arma maintained Arabic as a language of administration and identity, they also adopted local languages, customs, and religious practices. Their Islam was shaped by Sahelian traditions; their political culture combined Moroccan forms with indigenous patterns. [P]

**Autonomy from Morocco:** As Morocco descended into civil war after al-Mansur's death, the arma governors increasingly acted independently. By the mid-seventeenth century, the connection to Marrakesh was largely nominal. The arma ruled the Niger Bend as an independent or semi-independent polity, choosing their own leaders and managing their own affairs. [E]

### Political Evolution

The arma regime that emerged from Judar's conquest persisted for over two centuries, though in increasingly fragmented and weakened form. The pashas of Timbuktu wielded real power in the early period but became increasingly ceremonial as the arma class fractured into competing factions. Timbuktu remained a city of significance — it never lost all its scholarly traditions — but it was a diminished place, a shadow of its Songhai-era glory. [E]

The political legacy of the Moroccan conquest was fragmentation. The Songhai Empire had unified the Middle Niger under a single administration; the arma regime never achieved comparable control. The Tuareg, the Fulani, the remnant Songhai communities, and various other groups contested power throughout the region. The stability that had characterized Askia Dawud's reign was not restored for centuries. [E]

## The Moroccan Perspective vs. the Songhai Perspective

### Moroccan Sources

Moroccan chronicles, such as the anonymous *Nuzhat al-Hadi*, present the expedition as a triumph of Islamic arms against a decadent and impious enemy. In this telling, Ahmad al-Mansur was a righteous sultan extending the reach of proper Islam; the Songhai, despite their nominal Muslim faith, had fallen into error and weakness; Judar was the instrument of divine will, bringing the Sudan under the authority of a more legitimate Islamic ruler. [P]

This perspective conveniently ignored several realities:

- The Songhai state was demonstrably Muslim, with a scholarly tradition that in some respects exceeded Morocco's own
- The invasion was motivated primarily by economic greed, not religious reform
- The conquest resulted in the destruction of Islamic learning centers and the persecution of scholars
- The gold that justified the enterprise proved largely illusory

The Moroccan sources also tend to minimize the difficulties of the expedition, the casualties of the crossing, and the ongoing challenges of the occupation. They present Tondibi as a straightforward victory rather than the complex, destructive event it actually was. [P]

### Songhai Sources

The Timbuktu chronicles — the *Tarikh al-Sudan* of al-Sa'di and the *Tarikh al-Fattash* of the Kati family — present a sharply different perspective. For these authors, writing in the decades after the conquest, the Moroccan invasion was an unmitigated catastrophe that destroyed a flourishing civilization:

**The empire was at its height:** The Songhai under Askia Dawud had reached cultural and administrative peaks; the weakness that followed his death was temporary, not terminal, before the Moroccan attack.

**The conquest was unjust:** The Moroccans invaded without legitimate cause — they were not defending themselves, spreading Islam to pagans, or punishing actual wrongdoing. They came for gold.

**The destruction was cultural genocide:** The suppression of scholars, the looting of libraries, the disruption of trade and learning — these were crimes against civilization, not acts of legitimate war.

**The aftermath was chaos:** The arma occupation brought neither prosperity nor stability, only exploitation and decline. [E]

The Songhai sources do not demonize Judar personally in the way they might demonize a figure like Sunni Ali (whose religious ambiguity made him a theological villain for the scholars). Judar appears in these accounts as what he was: a competent military commander executing his master's orders. The villain, to the extent there is one, is Ahmad al-Mansur, whose greed launched the enterprise. But the scholars who recorded the history were too close to the events to write with detachment. Their bitterness pervades every page. [E]

### A Decolonizing Assessment

From a contemporary perspective that centers African agency and rejects narratives of European or external "civilizing" intervention, the Moroccan conquest of Songhai must be understood as imperial aggression against a sophisticated African civilization:

**Songhai was not primitive:** This was a state with bureaucratic administration, written legal traditions, commercial regulation, and intellectual institutions. Its scholars — men like Ahmad Baba — were among the finest minds in the Islamic world, not backward peoples awaiting enlightenment.

**The conquest was destructive, not constructive:** The Moroccan invasion did not bring "civilization" to the Sudan; it destroyed an existing civilization. The manuscript libraries, the scholarly networks, the administrative systems — all were damaged or demolished.

**The gold narrative was a pretext:** Ahmad al-Mansur wanted gold. The religious language in Moroccan sources should not obscure this basic fact. The expedition was a treasure-hunting raid dressed in Islamic rhetoric.

**The long-term consequences were catastrophic:** The political fragmentation, economic disruption, and cultural loss that followed Tondibi lasted for centuries. The Sahel's trajectory might have been very different if the Songhai state had survived — we cannot know what was lost.

Judar was the instrument of this destruction. He was also a man whose own life had been shaped by violence and enslavement — captured as a child, castrated, converted, raised to serve others' purposes. There is a terrible irony in a slave destroying a civilization, but that irony does not excuse the destruction or diminish the loss. [P]

## Personality and Character

### What the Sources Reveal

The sources provide limited information about Judar's personality, focusing on his military actions rather than his inner life. What emerges is a portrait of competence rather than charisma:

**Military skill:** The successful crossing of the Sahara and the decisive victory at Tondibi demonstrate genuine military ability. The logistical challenges alone would have defeated a lesser commander, and the battle itself required discipline and tactical judgment. [E]

**Discipline and determination:** The desert crossing — five months of heat, thirst, and death — required driving his men (and himself) beyond normal human limits. Judar clearly possessed the ruthless determination necessary for such an enterprise. [P]

**Obedience to authority:** Judar was, at root, a slave executing his master's commands. His identity was bound up with service to the Sa'adi sultan. When recalled from the Sudan, he returned; when sent back, he went. The sources do not record any instance of independent initiative that conflicted with al-Mansur's wishes. [P]

**Limited cultural vision:** Nothing suggests that Judar valued or even understood what he was destroying. The scholarly traditions of Timbuktu were apparently of no interest to him — merely obstacles to be removed or irrelevant features of the landscape. This may reflect his education (focused on military matters rather than scholarship) or simple lack of imagination. [S]

### What the Sources Omit

Almost everything else about Judar as a person is lost:

- His feelings about his origins and enslavement
- His relationships with family, friends, or peers (if any)
- His religious beliefs and practices beyond nominal conformity
- His thoughts about the enterprise he was leading
- His reaction to the destruction he caused
- His experience of the recall and its implications

We are left with an outline — a competent soldier, a loyal servant, a man who did his duty — but no inner life, no complexity, no humanity beyond the role he played in history. [S]

## Scholarly Debates

| Question | Position A | Position B | Current Consensus |
|----------|------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Spanish origins** | Judar was born in Las Cuevas, Almeria, based on later Spanish records | His exact birthplace is unknown; Spanish origin is certain but specific location uncertain | [P] Spanish origin established; Las Cuevas is traditional but unconfirmed |
| **Army size at Tondibi** | ~4,000 Moroccan troops vs. 30,000-40,000 Songhai | ~4,000 Moroccans vs. 12,500 Songhai (conservative estimate) | [D] Moroccan numbers fairly certain; Songhai numbers range widely |
| **Responsibility for scholarly persecution** | Judar initiated the occupation that led to persecution | The worst persecution (Ahmad Baba's arrest) came under his successor | [D] Judar established the occupation; Mahmud Zarqun intensified repression |
| **Death date and circumstances** | Died c. 1606, possibly in combat | Died after returning to Morocco, date uncertain | [D] Death around 1606 probable; circumstances unknown |
| **Assessment of military achievement** | Tondibi was a remarkable military victory against overwhelming odds | The technological advantage was so great that the outcome was inevitable | [P] Both elements present: genuine skill required, but technological asymmetry was decisive |

### The "What If" Question

Some scholars have asked whether the Moroccan conquest was inevitable or whether different Songhai decisions might have produced a different outcome. Could the Songhai have acquired firearms of their own? Could they have avoided a set-piece battle where the Moroccan firepower advantage was maximized? Could they have harassed the Moroccan expedition during its vulnerable desert crossing?

These counterfactuals are ultimately unanswerable, but they highlight the contingency of the conquest. The Songhai were not doomed by some civilizational inadequacy; they were defeated by a specific technological mismatch in a specific battle. Different circumstances might have produced different results. The destruction that followed was not inevitable but was the outcome of choices made by Ahmad al-Mansur, Askia Ishaq II, and Judar himself. [D]

## For Fiction Writing

### Dramatic Potential

**Fiction Potential: HIGH** — Judar Pasha's life offers extraordinary material for historical fiction, combining personal tragedy (enslavement, loss of identity) with world-historical consequences (destruction of an empire). His story raises questions about agency, complicity, and the moral weight of actions taken under compulsion.

### Central Dramatic Tensions

**The slave who conquers:** Judar was himself a victim of the same systems of violence and domination that he would inflict on others. A man with no freedom of his own destroyed the freedom of an entire civilization. This irony can be played for tragedy, moral complexity, or bitter commentary on the nature of empire.

**The instrument of destruction:** Judar did not choose to attack Songhai — he was ordered to do so. But he executed those orders with skill and determination. How should we judge a man who destroys a civilization on someone else's behalf? Is following orders an excuse? Is capability the same as culpability?

**The cultural blind spot:** Nothing suggests that Judar understood or valued what he was destroying. The libraries of Timbuktu, the scholarly traditions, the administrative sophistication — all apparently invisible to him. This blindness can be presented as tragedy (he was never educated to understand), villainy (he didn't care), or simple realism (soldiers rarely appreciate the cultures they destroy).

**The disappointment:** Judar conquered an empire and failed to satisfy his master. The gold was not there — or rather, it was not there in the form al-Mansur expected. The expedition that should have made both men's fortunes instead became a source of frustration and recrimination.

### Sensory World

**The Trans-Saharan March:**
- The desert landscape: endless dunes, rocky plateaus, gravel plains — monotony broken only by the distant shimmer of oases
- The heat: crushing, inescapable, sapping strength with every step; the sun a physical weight
- Thirst: the obsession that dominates everything, the taste of water becoming more precious than gold
- The night cold: temperatures dropping sharply after sunset, men huddling together for warmth
- Death: men collapsing, camels dying, the army shrinking daily; the smell of death in the desert
- The supplies dwindling: the mathematics of survival — how many days to the next water, how much food remains, how many will die before we arrive
- The soldiers: Spanish renegades, Moroccan cavalrymen, enslaved fighters — men from many places united in misery
- The sound: wind across sand, the groaning of camels, the rasp of breathing, the silence of exhaustion
- The end of the crossing: the first green on the horizon, the knowledge that survival is now possible

**The Battle of Tondibi:**
- The Songhai army: thousands of cavalry, banners flying, drums beating — an overwhelming mass of horsemen
- The cattle: hundreds of animals driven forward in a living wall, dust rising, bellowing
- The Moroccan formation: musketeers in ranks, matches lit, waiting
- The volley: the crash of hundreds of firearms firing together, smoke obscuring everything
- The cattle stampede: animals screaming, turning, crashing back into the Songhai ranks
- The cavalry charge: horses and riders falling, the impossibility of reaching an enemy that kills at distance
- The rout: Songhai warriors breaking, fleeing, pursued by bullets and the knowledge of defeat
- The aftermath: bodies scattered across the field, the moans of the wounded, the silence of victory

**Occupied Timbuktu:**
- The city: mud-brick buildings in shades of brown and gold, narrow streets, the great mosques rising above
- The scholars: men in white robes and turbans, watching the conquerors with silent hostility
- The libraries: rooms filled with manuscripts — leather bindings, ink on paper, centuries of accumulated wisdom
- The markets: subdued, nervous, the old prosperity disrupted
- The soldiers: arrogant conquerors, foreign faces, unintelligible languages
- The suppression: soldiers entering scholarly homes, confiscating books, leading away prisoners
- Ahmad Baba in chains: the greatest scholar of Timbuktu being marched out of the city he had served

**The Moroccan Court:**
- Marrakesh: a different world from the conquered Sudan — elaborate palaces, gardens, flowing water
- Ahmad al-Mansur: the sultan in his splendor, demanding gold that does not exist
- The eunuch's quarters: the liminal space Judar inhabits, neither slave nor free
- The recall: receiving orders to return, the ambiguous message of disappointment and continued service

### Speech and Voice

**Military commands:** Direct, urgent, the language of discipline and survival. Orders must be clear; the desert allows no ambiguity.

**With the sultan:** Deferential, careful, the speech of a slave to his master. Judar cannot afford to displease.

**With subordinates:** Authoritative, demanding obedience, but perhaps also the camaraderie of shared ordeal. The men who survived the crossing together have bonds that rank cannot entirely override.

**Languages:** Judar would have spoken Arabic (his language of education and command), possibly some Spanish (his birth language, if he retained any memory of it), and whatever Portuguese, Italian, or other languages the renegades in his command used. The multilingual nature of the Moroccan army — Spanish converts, Moroccan Arabs, Berber tribesmen — created a babel of voices.

### Key Relationships

**Ahmad al-Mansur:** The sultan who owned him, commanded him, and would ultimately discard him. Their relationship was that of master and slave, however high Judar rose — and al-Mansur's disappointment with the gold that wasn't there shaped the end of Judar's career.

**Mahmud ibn Zarqun:** The commander who replaced Judar and intensified the persecution of Timbuktu's scholars. Their relationship — colleague, rival, successor — is not documented but offers fictional possibilities.

**The European renegades:** The Spanish and Portuguese soldiers in Judar's army were, like him, men who had crossed religious and cultural boundaries. Some had converted willingly; others had been captured like Judar himself. What did they make of their commander, a fellow convert who had risen so high?

**Ahmad Baba:** The great scholar and the conquering general almost certainly never met — Ahmad Baba was arrested after Judar's recall. But they stand as polar opposites: the man of learning and the man of war, the preserver and the destroyer.

**Askia Ishaq II:** The Songhai ruler Judar defeated. Their relationship was that of opponents in battle, but each was in some sense a victim of forces larger than himself — Ishaq of technological change, Judar of his own enslaved status.

### Scene Opportunities

1. **The child captured:** Young Judar seized from his Spanish home, the beginning of his transformation from Christian peasant to Muslim commander.

2. **The castration:** The moment of greatest violence against his person, the wound that would define his social position for life. (This scene would be difficult to write but central to understanding the costs of his elevation.)

3. **Rising in the Sa'adi court:** The years of service, the building of skills and trust, the gradual ascent to positions of responsibility.

4. **Receiving the commission:** Al-Mansur ordering the expedition, the enormity of what is being asked, the impossibility of refusal.

5. **The desert crossing:** Multiple scenes of suffering, death, discipline, survival. The making of a shared ordeal.

6. **Night before Tondibi:** Judar contemplating the battle to come, knowing that everything depends on tomorrow.

7. **The battle itself:** The cattle stampede, the volleys, the rout, the victory that feels hollow.

8. **Entering Timbuktu:** The conqueror in the city of learning, the books he cannot read, the scholars who hate him.

9. **The recall:** Receiving al-Mansur's summons, the message that victory was not enough.

10. **The second expedition:** Older now, wiser perhaps, sent back to a problem that has no solution.

11. **Death in the Sudan:** However it came — battle, illness, exhaustion — the end of a man whose life had been shaped by others' purposes.

### Worldview and Values

**Duty and obedience:** Judar was a slave; his identity was bound up with service. Questioning orders was not in his repertoire. This is not admirable by modern standards, but it is comprehensible in its context.

**Professional pride:** Whatever his personal feelings, Judar took pride in his military competence. The crossing of the Sahara was a genuine achievement; Tondibi was a genuine victory. Professional soldiers often find meaning in the excellence of their craft, whatever the purposes it serves.

**Religious conformity:** Judar was a convert to Islam — whether sincere or nominal, we cannot know. His public behavior was that of a Muslim, and there is no evidence he retained any attachment to his birth religion.

**Lack of cultural vision:** The sources suggest no interest in learning, scholarship, or the preservation of knowledge. The libraries of Timbuktu were apparently of no more concern to him than any other aspect of the conquered landscape.

**The loneliness of enslavement:** Judar had no family that we know of, no children (he was a eunuch), no lineage, no independent identity. His entire meaning derived from his service. This loneliness — however successfully masked — must have shaped his inner life.

### The Moral Problem

A fiction centered on Judar must grapple with the moral complexity of his position:

**He was a slave:** His choices were constrained by his status. He did not decide to attack Songhai; he was ordered to do so. Can we judge a man for actions he was compelled to take?

**He was competent:** The expedition's success was not inevitable; it required genuine military skill. Judar did his job well. Is doing evil well worse than doing it poorly?

**He destroyed a civilization:** Whatever the constraints on his choices, the consequences of his actions were catastrophic. The manuscripts burned, the scholars exiled, the political fragmentation that followed — Judar's victory made all of this possible.

**He was also a victim:** The same systems of violence and domination that he inflicted on Songhai had shaped his own life. He had been captured, enslaved, castrated, converted. In some sense, he was passing on the trauma that had been inflicted on him.

There is no easy resolution to these tensions. A fiction that takes Judar seriously must hold all of them together — the slave and the conqueror, the victim and the perpetrator, the competent professional and the destroyer of civilizations.

### Source Assessment

Judar Pasha is documented primarily through the Timbuktu chronicles (hostile to the Moroccan conquest) and Moroccan court chronicles (propagandistic in their own way). The combination provides a reasonably clear picture of the military events — the expedition, the battle, the occupation — but offers limited insight into Judar's personal life, motivations, or inner experience.

The main gaps in our knowledge include:
- The specific details of his capture and early life
- His thoughts and feelings about his mission
- His relationships with other individuals
- The circumstances of his death

For fiction purposes, these gaps provide space for creative interpretation while the documented events provide a solid historical framework.
