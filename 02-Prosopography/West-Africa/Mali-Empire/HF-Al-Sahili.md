## Overview

Abu Ishaq Ibrahim al-Sahili was an Andalusian architect, poet, and scholar from Granada who accompanied Mansa Musa on his return journey from the hajj in 1324-1325 and settled in the Mali Empire, where he became one of the most influential figures in the transformation of Sahelian architecture. His arrival in Mali represents one of the most significant instances of cultural and technological exchange between the Islamic Mediterranean world and Sub-Saharan Africa, and his architectural legacy — whether directly attributable to him or developed by Malian builders working from techniques he introduced — shaped the distinctive "Sudano-Sahelian" architectural style that continues to define cities like Timbuktu and Djenne today.

Al-Sahili's story is remarkable for what it reveals about the mobility and interconnectedness of the medieval Islamic world. A man from the Nasrid kingdom of Granada — then the last Muslim state on the Iberian Peninsula, under increasing pressure from the Christian Reconquista — could meet the ruler of the greatest empire in West Africa during a pilgrimage to Mecca, accept an invitation to journey thousands of miles across the Sahara Desert, and spend the remainder of his life building monuments in a land utterly different from his birthplace. His career demonstrates that for educated Muslims in this period, the *dar al-Islam* (the House of Islam) was not merely a concept but a lived reality of networks, opportunities, and shared cultural frameworks that transcended geographic distance.

The sources for al-Sahili's life are fragmentary and complicated by later legendary elaboration. Contemporary Arabic chroniclers like al-Umari mention him briefly; Ibn Khaldun provides genealogical details; later sources like the *Tarikh al-Sudan* (compiled in the 17th century) attribute specific buildings to him. Separating historical fact from the accumulated traditions of centuries is challenging. What is clear is that al-Sahili became a figure of enduring memory in Timbuktu's cultural history, that he was associated with important architectural innovations, and that his story exemplifies the trans-Saharan connections that shaped medieval West African civilization. The question of how much credit belongs to him personally versus to the Malian builders who adapted, developed, and perpetuated the architectural tradition he may have influenced is one of the central scholarly debates surrounding his legacy.

## Early Life and Background

### Origins in Al-Andalus

Abu Ishaq Ibrahim al-Sahili was born in Granada, the capital of the Nasrid Emirate, around 1290 CE. [P] The Nasrid kingdom (1238-1492) was the last Muslim-ruled territory on the Iberian Peninsula, a remnant of the once-vast al-Andalus that had shrunk under centuries of Christian reconquest to a relatively small but wealthy state in southern Spain. Granada in al-Sahili's youth was a cultural jewel — home to the Alhambra palace (construction of which was ongoing during his lifetime), a center of Islamic learning and poetry, and a cosmopolitan city where Muslim, Jewish, and Christian communities interacted despite the larger political context of religious conflict.

Ibn Khaldun provides the fullest account of al-Sahili's origins, identifying him as a member of a respected Granada family and noting his accomplishments as a poet. [P] The nisba "al-Sahili" suggests connection to the Banu Sahil, a family known in Granada's scholarly and administrative circles. His nickname "al-Tuwayjin" ("the little crown" or "the poet") reflects his reputation for literary accomplishment. [P]

Al-Sahili would have received the education typical of an elite Andalusian Muslim — Quranic studies, Arabic grammar and rhetoric, poetry, and likely some training in geometry, astronomy, and the practical arts that informed architecture. The Andalusian architectural tradition was one of the most sophisticated in the medieval Islamic world, and while there is no evidence that al-Sahili was a professional architect in Granada in the modern sense, an educated man of his background would have been familiar with architectural principles and aesthetics. [P]

### The Andalusian Context

To understand al-Sahili's later career, the precarious position of Granada in the early 14th century must be appreciated. The Nasrid emirate survived by a combination of diplomacy, tribute payments to Castile, and periodic military resistance. It was a wealthy state — Granada controlled silk production and trade through the port of Almeria — but its long-term survival was uncertain. Educated Granadans of al-Sahili's generation lived with the awareness that their civilization might not endure, that the Reconquista might eventually complete its centuries-long project of expelling Muslim rule from the peninsula.

This context helps explain why al-Sahili might have been receptive to opportunities elsewhere in the Islamic world. For an Andalusian Muslim, the hajj was not merely a religious obligation but an opportunity to reconnect with the broader *umma* (Islamic community), to visit the great centers of learning in Cairo, Damascus, and the Hijaz, and potentially to find new patrons and opportunities in lands where Islam was not under siege. [S]

### Path to the Hajj

The circumstances that brought al-Sahili to the Hijaz in 1324-1325, where he encountered Mansa Musa, are not recorded in detail. He appears to have been undertaking the hajj as a scholar and poet — perhaps seeking patronage in the wealthier eastern Islamic lands, perhaps fulfilling a religious obligation, or perhaps a combination of both. His poetry was apparently known and respected, as the sources consistently identify him by his sobriquet "al-Tuwayjin" and note his literary accomplishments. [P]

Al-Sahili may have been part of the loose networks of Andalusian emigres who, facing the gradual decline of Muslim power in Spain, sought opportunities in North Africa, Egypt, or beyond. The Marinid sultanate of Morocco, in particular, provided refuge and employment for Andalusian scholars and craftsmen. However, al-Sahili's decision to accompany Mansa Musa to Sub-Saharan Africa took him far beyond the typical circuits of Andalusian migration. [S]

---

## The Encounter with Mansa Musa

### Meeting in Cairo or Mecca (1324-1325)

The meeting between Abu Ishaq al-Sahili and Mansa Musa occurred during the famous hajj of 1324-1325, one of the most spectacular pilgrimages in Islamic history. Musa's caravan — reportedly including 60,000 people and vast quantities of gold — passed through Cairo in July 1324 before continuing to Mecca, returning through Cairo on the way home. [E]

The exact circumstances of their meeting are not recorded with precision. Al-Umari, our most detailed contemporary source for Musa's hajj, mentions that Musa brought back scholars and architects from his pilgrimage, but does not name al-Sahili specifically in the passages that survive. [P] Ibn Khaldun, writing later in the century based on information gathered from West African scholars and merchants, provides more detail about al-Sahili, including his Andalusian origin and his journey to Mali. [P]

The meeting likely occurred in either Cairo or the Hijaz (Mecca/Medina). Given al-Sahili's Andalusian background, he may have been among the many scholars, poets, and travelers who sought to meet the fabulously wealthy African ruler whose generosity was disrupting the Egyptian economy. Alternatively, they may have encountered each other during the hajj rituals themselves. [S]

### The Invitation

Why would Mansa Musa invite an Andalusian poet to accompany him back to Mali? Several factors may have contributed:

**Cultural Prestige:** Andalusian scholars and artists enjoyed enormous prestige throughout the Islamic world. Al-Andalus had been a center of learning, poetry, and aesthetic refinement for centuries, and its scholars carried the cultural capital of that tradition. Bringing an Andalusian to his court would enhance Musa's reputation as a patron of learning. [P]

**Architectural Expertise:** Although the sources emphasize al-Sahili's poetic accomplishments, he clearly possessed architectural knowledge that Musa valued. The Andalusian architectural tradition — with its sophisticated use of geometry, decoration, and fired brick — represented techniques that could transform the built environment of the Sahel. Musa, who was engaged in an ambitious program of mosque-building and urban development, would have recognized the potential value of such expertise. [P]

**Personal Connection:** The hajj created intense social environments in which pilgrims from across the Islamic world interacted. Musa may have been personally impressed by al-Sahili's poetry, conversation, or piety. The sources suggest that Musa valued learned men and sought to attract them to his court. [P]

**The Offer:** Ibn Khaldun records that Musa paid al-Sahili extremely well — reportedly giving him 12,000 mithqals of gold (a mithqal was approximately 4.25 grams, so this would be over 50 kilograms of gold, worth a fortune by any standard). [P] This payment, whether a single gift or accumulated over years, indicates the high value Musa placed on al-Sahili's services and perhaps reflects the extraordinary cost of convincing a sophisticated Andalusian to relocate permanently to Sub-Saharan Africa.

## Journey to Mali and Settlement

### The Saharan Crossing

Al-Sahili's journey from Cairo to Mali required crossing the Sahara Desert — one of the most challenging journeys in the medieval world. The crossing covered approximately 1,500 miles of some of Earth's most inhospitable terrain and took roughly two months under favorable conditions. [E]

The experience of this crossing for an Andalusian accustomed to Granada's Mediterranean climate and urban amenities must have been profound. The vast emptiness of the desert, the reliance on Saharan guides and oasis stops, the brutal heat by day and cold by night — these would have been utterly foreign experiences. That al-Sahili completed this journey and chose to remain in Mali for the rest of his life speaks to either the strength of the attraction (Musa's patronage) or the weakness of his alternatives (perhaps no secure place to return to in al-Andalus). [S]

### Arrival and Integration

Al-Sahili arrived in Mali with Musa's returning caravan, probably in late 1325 or early 1326. [P] He entered a world dramatically different from Granada — a tropical savanna climate, a predominantly oral culture (despite the presence of Islamic literacy), and an architectural tradition based on mud brick (banco) rather than the fired brick and stone of Andalusian construction.

The Mali Empire at this moment was at the apex of its power. Musa ruled a vast territory, commanded enormous wealth from the gold trade, and was actively engaged in constructing an Islamic cultural infrastructure — mosques, schools, and royal buildings that would demonstrate both his piety and his civilization's sophistication. Al-Sahili entered this environment as a valued foreign expert, bringing skills and aesthetic sensibilities that could serve Musa's ambitious building program. [P]

### Life at the Mali Court

Little is known about al-Sahili's daily life in Mali beyond his architectural activities. As a foreign scholar at Musa's court, he would have been part of the cosmopolitan Muslim elite that included traders from across the Sahara, scholars attracted by Mali's patronage, and the indigenous Muslim population that had developed over generations of trans-Saharan contact.

The sources suggest that al-Sahili continued to write poetry in Mali, though none of his compositions from this period survive. [T] He appears to have been highly honored — Ibn Khaldun's note about his enormous payment indicates that Musa valued him greatly, and later traditions associate him with a high status at court.

The cultural adjustment required for an Andalusian to flourish in Mali should not be underestimated. Despite shared Islamic faith, the differences in language, social organization, climate, and daily life between Granada and the Niger Bend were enormous. Al-Sahili apparently made this adjustment successfully, as he remained in Mali for the rest of his life. [P]

## Architectural Works and Innovations

### The Fired-Brick Innovation

Al-Sahili is traditionally credited with introducing fired-brick (baked brick) construction to the Mali Empire. [P] The standard building material in the Sahel was sun-dried mud brick (banco or adobe) — a technology indigenous to the region that produced durable structures but required regular maintenance, as rain and weathering degraded the mud surfaces over time.

Fired brick, produced by baking clay bricks in kilns at high temperatures, created a more durable building material that could withstand weathering better than banco. The technique was well-established in the Mediterranean world (including al-Andalus) but was not in common use in Sub-Saharan Africa before this period. [P]

**The Innovation Debate:**
However, the extent to which al-Sahili truly "introduced" fired brick, versus adapted or promoted techniques already known, is debated. Some scholars note that:

1. Fired brick appears at other West African sites in periods that may predate or be contemporary with al-Sahili (the chronology is uncertain). [D]
2. Indigenous Sahelian builders were highly sophisticated and may have been experimenting with fired-brick techniques independently. [P]
3. The attribution of innovation to a foreign figure may partly reflect later traditions that assigned prestigious architectural achievements to a named, prestigious individual rather than to anonymous local builders. [P]

**The Balanced View:**
The most likely scenario is that al-Sahili brought specific Andalusian architectural knowledge — techniques, aesthetic principles, perhaps methods of kiln construction — that local Malian builders then adapted, developed, and incorporated into their own evolving tradition. The "Sudano-Sahelian" style that emerged was not simply transplanted Andalusian architecture but a creative synthesis produced primarily by African builders working with African materials in African contexts, influenced by (but not merely copying) techniques and ideas that figures like al-Sahili introduced. [P]

This interpretation centers African agency in the creation of Sudano-Sahelian architecture while acknowledging the role of trans-Saharan cultural exchange. The distinctive mud-brick mosques and buildings of Timbuktu, Djenne, and other Sahelian cities are African achievements, however much they may have been influenced by ideas from elsewhere.

### The Djinguereber Mosque, Timbuktu

The most important building associated with al-Sahili is the Djinguereber Mosque (also spelled Djingareiber or Jingereber) in Timbuktu, one of the three great mosque-universities of the city and one of the most famous buildings in West African history. [P]

**Historical Attribution:**
The attribution of Djinguereber to al-Sahili comes primarily from later sources, particularly the *Tarikh al-Sudan* (compiled in the 17th century by Abd al-Rahman al-Sa'di). This chronicle describes the mosque's construction under Musa's patronage and credits al-Sahili with the design. [P]

However, the *Tarikh al-Sudan* was written approximately 300 years after the events it describes, and its account may incorporate legendary traditions that accumulated over the intervening centuries. Contemporary sources (al-Umari, Ibn Khaldun) mention that Musa built mosques but do not specifically name al-Sahili as the architect of Djinguereber. [D]

**The Building:**
The Djinguereber Mosque as it exists today has been rebuilt and renovated many times since the 14th century. The characteristic banco construction with protruding wooden beams (toron) that serve both as scaffolding supports and decorative elements is typical of Sudano-Sahelian style. The mosque features:

- Massive mud-brick walls with distinctive buttressing
- A large prayer hall with pillars supporting the roof
- A minaret that dominates the Timbuktu skyline
- A courtyard for ablutions and gathering
- Integration of the building into the social and scholarly life of the city

What relationship, if any, the current structure has to whatever al-Sahili may have built in the 14th century is impossible to determine. Banco buildings require constant maintenance and periodic reconstruction; the mosque has been rebuilt multiple times over the centuries. [E]

**UNESCO World Heritage Status:**
The Djinguereber Mosque was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1988 as part of the "Timbuktu" listing. It remains an active place of worship and a symbol of Timbuktu's Islamic heritage.

### The Royal Palace (Madugu) at Niani

Al-Sahili is also credited with building a royal palace or audience chamber, sometimes called the "Madugu," reportedly at Mali's capital (conventionally identified as Niani, though the location is debated). [T]

**The Sources:**
This attribution is even more poorly documented than the Djinguereber Mosque. The term "Madugu" itself is of uncertain origin and meaning. Some sources suggest it was a domed audience hall — a structure that would have been architecturally significant if constructed in mud brick, as dome construction poses particular challenges in this medium.

**The Evidence Problem:**
No archaeological remains of this palace have been definitively identified. The site of Niani itself is debated (see [[HF-Mansa-Musa|Mansa Musa]] entry for discussion), and even if correctly located, excavations have not revealed structures matching the descriptions of a grand royal palace. [D]

It is possible that:
1. The palace existed but has not survived or been discovered
2. The palace existed in a different location than modern Niani
3. The traditions about a grand palace have been exaggerated or conflated over time
4. Al-Sahili built something that was later remembered with embellishment

The honest assessment is that we cannot confirm the existence, location, or characteristics of this building with confidence. [S]

### Other Possible Works

Later traditions associate al-Sahili with buildings in Gao (the future Songhai capital, then under Mali's control) and possibly elsewhere. [T] These attributions are even less well-documented than those for Djinguereber and the Niani palace. It is possible that al-Sahili was involved in multiple building projects during his years in Mali, but specific attributions beyond Timbuktu rest on tradition rather than contemporary documentation.

## Role as Poet and Intellectual

### Poetry in Mali

Al-Sahili came to Mali primarily known as a poet (hence his sobriquet "al-Tuwayjin"), and the sources consistently emphasize his literary reputation alongside his architectural achievements. [P]

Unfortunately, none of al-Sahili's poetry — whether composed in al-Andalus, during his travels, or in Mali — has survived. We know he was considered an accomplished poet because the sources say so, but we cannot evaluate his work directly. This is a common problem in medieval literary history, where authors are named and praised but their actual compositions are lost.

**Poetry's Role:**
In the medieval Islamic world, poetry was not merely aesthetic entertainment but a prestigious cultural practice with political, religious, and social functions. Court poets praised rulers, commemorated victories, elegized the dead, and participated in the cultural life of the elite. An accomplished poet like al-Sahili would have been valued not just for his verses but for the cultural prestige his presence brought to Musa's court.

The tradition of Arabic poetry at the Mali court, which al-Sahili exemplified, coexisted with the indigenous Mande tradition of praise-singing (jeli/griot performance). These two poetic traditions served similar social functions — celebrating rulers, preserving memory, providing entertainment — but operated in different linguistic and aesthetic frameworks. How al-Sahili, as an Arabic poet, interacted with the Mande griot tradition is unknown but would have been an interesting cultural encounter. [S]

### Scholarly Contributions

Beyond poetry, al-Sahili was apparently a learned man in the broader Islamic scholarly tradition. His architectural work implies knowledge of geometry and practical mathematics; his position at court suggests respect as an intellectual. However, no scholarly works (treatises, commentaries, legal opinions) are attributed to him, and he does not appear in the biographical dictionaries of Islamic scholars in the way that major intellectuals do. [P]

His primary legacy was architectural and cultural rather than scholarly in the strict sense — he was remembered as a builder and poet, not as a theologian, jurist, or philosopher.

---

## Death and Immediate Legacy

### Death in Mali (c. 1346)

Al-Sahili died in Mali around 1346 CE, approximately twenty years after his arrival with Mansa Musa. [P] He never returned to al-Andalus. The circumstances of his death are not recorded — whether he died of natural causes, illness, or other factors is unknown.

He was buried in Mali, though the exact location of his grave is not known with certainty. Later traditions associated various sites in Timbuktu or elsewhere with his burial, but these attributions are not independently confirmed. [T]

### Mansa Musa's Death

The dating of al-Sahili's death (c. 1346) suggests that he outlived Mansa Musa, who died around 1337. [P] This means al-Sahili would have also served under Mansa Maghan I (Musa's son, r. 1337-1341) and possibly into the early reign of Mansa Sulayman (r. 1341-1360). However, the sources do not describe his activities during these later reigns.

It is possible that al-Sahili's influence declined after Musa's death, that his major building activities were completed during Musa's reign, or simply that the sources have not preserved information about his later years. His association in historical memory is overwhelmingly with Mansa Musa rather than with any later ruler.

### The Memory of Al-Sahili

Al-Sahili became a figure of enduring memory in Timbuktu and Mali more broadly. By the time the *Tarikh al-Sudan* was compiled in the 17th century — over 300 years after his death — he was firmly associated with the city's greatest mosque and remembered as the bringer of new architectural techniques. This suggests that traditions about him were preserved and transmitted over the intervening centuries, though we cannot determine how much these traditions changed or elaborated over time.

The preservation of al-Sahili's memory may reflect:
1. Genuine historical impact that was remembered through oral or written tradition
2. The tendency to attribute significant achievements to named, prestigious individuals
3. The cultural importance of the buildings associated with him, which kept his name alive
4. The symbolic significance of his story as an example of trans-Saharan cultural connection

---

## The Sudano-Sahelian Architectural Legacy

### The Style

The "Sudano-Sahelian" architectural style that al-Sahili is credited with influencing (or founding) is characterized by:

**Materials:**
- Banco (sun-dried mud brick) as the primary building material
- Fired brick used selectively (for certain structural elements)
- Palm wood beams (toron) projecting from walls
- Plaster and mud rendering on exterior surfaces

**Features:**
- Massive, organic forms with soft, curved lines
- Buttressed walls that taper upward
- Flat roofs with drainage spouts
- Minarets that are broad-based and taper toward the top
- Integration of structural and decorative elements (the toron serve both functions)
- Regular maintenance and replastering as part of community life

**Iconic Examples:**
- Djinguereber Mosque, Timbuktu (14th century and later)
- Sankore Mosque, Timbuktu (origins possibly earlier, rebuilt multiple times)
- Great Mosque of Djenne (original 13th century, current structure 1907)
- Agadez Mosque, Niger (16th century)

### African Authorship

It is crucial to emphasize that the Sudano-Sahelian style is an African architectural tradition, regardless of what influences may have contributed to its development. The builders who created and perpetuated this tradition were West African masons — often members of hereditary guilds organized along lines similar to the nyamakala occupational castes of Mande society. [P]

The guild traditions of Djenne, in particular, have preserved techniques for banco construction over many generations. The annual replastering festival of the Great Mosque of Djenne (the Crepissage) is a community event that involves the entire city and represents the living continuation of building traditions that may trace back to the medieval period. These traditions are maintained by African builders using African methods for African communities. [E]

If al-Sahili introduced certain techniques or ideas, he did so into a context where skilled builders already existed and where his contributions were adapted to local materials, climate, and social needs. The resulting architecture is no more "Andalusian" than American architecture is "English" — whatever the historical connections, the living tradition developed in and belongs to its African context.

### The "Who Built It?" Question

One of the underlying scholarly debates about al-Sahili concerns the broader question of African agency in African history. For much of the colonial and early post-colonial period, European and Arab influences on African achievements were emphasized (sometimes to the point of denying African achievement altogether, as in the notorious debates about Great Zimbabwe's builders). The question of how much credit al-Sahili deserves touches on this historiographic issue.

The balanced position — which this project adopts — is that:

1. Trans-Saharan cultural exchange was real and significant
2. Figures like al-Sahili brought skills and ideas that influenced Sahelian architecture
3. Local African builders were the primary agents who developed, adapted, and perpetuated the architectural tradition
4. The resulting architecture is African, belonging to its context and created by African hands and minds
5. Acknowledging external influences does not diminish African achievement; refusing to acknowledge African agency does diminish it

## Scholarly Debates

| Question | Position A | Position B | Current Consensus |
|----------|------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Did al-Sahili introduce fired brick to Mali?** | Yes — brought technique from al-Andalus | No — technique known earlier; he may have refined or promoted it | [D] Probably introduced or significantly advanced the technique, but African builders adapted it |
| **Did al-Sahili design the Djinguereber Mosque?** | Yes — later sources attribute it to him | Attribution uncertain; may be legendary accretion | [D] Probably associated with its construction; exact role unclear |
| **Did the "Madugu" palace exist?** | Yes — described in sources | No archaeological confirmation; may be exaggerated | [S] Possibly existed; evidence insufficient |
| **What was al-Sahili's primary contribution?** | Architectural innovation | Cultural prestige for Musa's court | [D] Probably both; sources emphasize both |
| **How much credit does al-Sahili deserve vs. local builders?** | Central figure — founder of architectural tradition | One influence among many; local builders were primary agents | [P] Significant influence; local builders created the tradition |

### The Payment Question

Ibn Khaldun's report that Musa paid al-Sahili 12,000 mithqals of gold (if accurate) indicates extraordinary compensation. This has led some scholars to question whether the figure is exaggerated or whether it represents accumulated payments over years rather than a single gift. The amount is so large (over 50 kg of gold, worth millions in modern terms) that it strains credibility as a single payment, yet the sources for Mali's wealth consistently describe quantities that seem fantastic by ordinary standards. [D]

The payment, whatever its exact amount, indicates that Musa valued al-Sahili highly. Whether this was primarily for his architectural services, his poetic accomplishments, his general cultural prestige, or some combination is unclear.

### Sources and Reliability

The primary challenge in studying al-Sahili is the temporal gap between the events (1320s-1340s) and our most detailed sources:

- **al-Umari** (c. 1337-1349): Near-contemporary; mentions scholars/architects accompanying Musa but does not name al-Sahili specifically in surviving passages [E]
- **Ibn Khaldun** (c. 1377): Written 30-50 years later; provides genealogical details and the 12,000 mithqal payment [P]
- **Leo Africanus** (c. 1526): Writing nearly 200 years later; mentions buildings in Timbuktu but does not specifically discuss al-Sahili [E]
- ***Tarikh al-Sudan*** (c. 1650s): Most detailed on al-Sahili's buildings, but written over 300 years after the events [T]

The progressive elaboration of al-Sahili's story over time — from brief mentions to detailed building attributions — may reflect either the accumulation of genuine tradition or the legendary accretion that often attaches to historically significant figures.

## For Fiction Writing

### Dramatic Potential

Al-Sahili's story offers compelling narrative possibilities: the Andalusian exile finding a new home in Africa, the creative partnership with one of history's wealthiest rulers, the cross-cultural encounter between Mediterranean sophistication and Sahelian grandeur, and the lasting legacy of buildings that transformed a civilization's built environment.

**Exile and Reinvention:**
Al-Sahili left a homeland under siege (Granada's long-term survival as a Muslim state was doubtful) and built a new life in a world utterly different from his origins. The psychological dimensions of this displacement — loss, adaptation, the finding of new purpose — offer rich material for character development.

**The Creative Partnership:**
The relationship between al-Sahili and Mansa Musa is potentially one of history's most interesting artistic partnerships. The ruler with unlimited resources and ambitious vision; the foreign artist with technical skills and aesthetic sensibilities; the project of transforming an empire's built environment through architecture. How did they communicate? (Through interpreters? In Arabic?) What was their creative process? How did al-Sahili's designs adapt to Malian materials and climate?

**The Building Projects:**
The construction of major buildings provides natural dramatic structure: the challenges of working with unfamiliar materials, the training of local builders, the solving of technical problems, the moment of completion. Building the Djinguereber Mosque would make a compelling central narrative.

**The Stranger's Perspective:**
Al-Sahili provides a natural viewpoint character for exploring Mali from an outsider's perspective — similar to Ibn Battuta's account of the Mali court under Sulayman. His reactions to Sahelian climate, culture, and society could illuminate aspects of Mali that a native perspective might take for granted.

### Sensory World

**Climate Contrast:**
- Granada: Mediterranean climate with mild winters, warm summers, orchards and gardens
- Mali: Tropical savanna with intense wet and dry seasons, the Niger River's floods and recessions
- The Sahara crossing: Desert heat, cold nights, sand, wind, the psychological weight of emptiness
- Timbuktu: The Niger's edge, the seasonal changes, the harmattan wind carrying Saharan dust

**Architecture:**
- Granada: The Alhambra's intricate tilework, carved stucco, fountains, gardens — a tradition of enclosed, water-cooled spaces
- Mali: Banco mud-brick, the organic shapes of Sahelian buildings, the feel of sun-dried earth under hands
- The building site: Scaffolding of palm trunks, the mixing of mud and straw, the rhythms of construction
- The completed mosque: Cool interior, light filtering through small windows, the sound of prayers echoing

**Sound:**
- Granada: Muezzin's call over the Alhambra, Andalusian music (oud, qanun), the Spanish spoken by Christian neighbors
- Mali: Different dialect of Arabic, Mande languages, the griot's kora and balafon, the call to prayer in an unfamiliar accent
- Construction: The thud of mud being shaped, the creak of wood scaffolding, the voices of workers

**Smell:**
- Granada: Orange blossoms, jasmine, the sea breeze from the coast
- Mali: The Niger River's mud and fish, cooking fires, shea butter, the dust of the dry season
- Banco construction: Wet mud and straw, the earthy smell of buildings rising from the ground

**Taste:**
- Granada: Mediterranean foods — olive oil, wheat bread, lamb, citrus, wine (for non-Muslims)
- Mali: Millet porridge, rice, grilled fish from the Niger, sauces with baobab and groundnuts
- The adjustment: Learning to appreciate new foods, missing the flavors of home

### Speech and Voice

**Languages:**
Al-Sahili spoke Arabic (his literary medium) and probably some form of Romance vernacular from his Granadan context. In Mali, he would have needed interpreters for communication with most people, though Arabic served as a lingua franca among the Muslim scholarly and merchant elite.

**Poetic Voice:**
As a poet, al-Sahili would have command of Classical Arabic's elaborate rhetoric — metaphor, imagery, formal structures. His speech in Arabic might be elegant, allusive, perhaps nostalgic for the literary culture he left behind.

**Technical Language:**
As a builder, he would need to communicate practical instructions — measurements, proportions, techniques. This might require developing a shared vocabulary with Malian masons, perhaps using gesture and demonstration where language failed.

**Character Voice Possibilities:**
- Melancholic elegance: A man mourning his lost homeland while building beauty in a new one
- Practical directness: A craftsman focused on solving technical problems
- Spiritual devotion: A Muslim finding new expression for his faith in African mosques
- Careful observation: A stranger noting everything unusual, comparing it to what he knew

### Key Relationships

**Mansa Musa:**
The patron-artist relationship between Musa and al-Sahili is central. How did they interact? Did Musa participate actively in design decisions, or delegate entirely? Was there mutual respect, friendship, or simply a transactional relationship? The power differential (Musa was one of the most powerful rulers in the world; al-Sahili was a dependent foreign expert) would shape their interactions.

**Malian Builders:**
Al-Sahili must have worked with local craftsmen — he could not have built anything alone. These relationships — the transmission of techniques, the negotiation between his ideas and their expertise, the collaborative process of creation — would have been fundamental to his work. Fiction could explore these unnamed Malian builders as significant characters in their own right.

**Other Foreign Scholars:**
Musa attracted scholars from across the Islamic world. Al-Sahili would have been part of a cosmopolitan elite at the Mali court, interacting with North Africans, Egyptians, and others. These peer relationships might have provided intellectual companionship and also rivalries.

**Women in the Court:**
The sources tell us nothing about al-Sahili's personal life — whether he married in Mali, whether he had children, how he interacted with Mali's women (who, as Ibn Battuta noted, appeared unveiled and held significant social positions). This lacuna in the record offers space for fictional exploration.

**Memory of Granada:**
Al-Sahili's relationship with his absent homeland — letters never sent (or sent and never received), memories of family left behind, news of events in al-Andalus reaching Mali years late — could be a poignant element of characterization.

### Scene Opportunities

1. **The Saharan Crossing:** Al-Sahili's first experience of the desert with Musa's returning caravan — the vastness, the heat, the moments of beauty and terror, the growing distance from everything familiar.

2. **First Sight of Timbuktu:** Arriving at the Niger's edge after the desert crossing — the river, the greenery, the existing city, the assessment of what needs to be built.

3. **The Design Session:** Al-Sahili and Musa discussing the mosque's design — negotiating between Musa's vision, al-Sahili's expertise, and the realities of Malian materials and climate.

4. **On the Scaffolding:** Al-Sahili working with Malian builders, demonstrating techniques, solving problems as they arise — the practical, physical work of construction.

5. **The First Prayer:** The completion of the Djinguereber Mosque and the first congregational prayer within it — the culmination of years of work, the sounds of worship in the space he created.

6. **News from Granada:** A merchant arriving with news from al-Andalus — perhaps political developments, perhaps personal news, triggering reflection on the path that brought al-Sahili to Africa.

7. **After Musa's Death:** The moment of learning that his patron has died — uncertainty about his position under the new ruler, reflection on what he has accomplished and what remains.

8. **The Poet at Night:** Al-Sahili composing poetry in his later years, looking back on his life's strange journey, writing verses that no one will remember.

### Worldview and Values

**Faith:**
Al-Sahili was a Muslim, and his work in Mali was in service of Islamic worship and community. His buildings were mosques — houses of prayer. This religious dimension would have informed his sense of purpose and meaning.

**Craft:**
As both poet and builder, al-Sahili valued making things well. The craftsman's attention to detail, the satisfaction of seeing work completed, the pride in excellence — these might have been core values.

**Memory:**
Al-Sahili lived between two worlds — Andalusian past and Malian present. The tension between nostalgia and adaptation, between what was lost and what was built new, might have been central to his inner life.

**Legacy:**
The buildings he created were meant to endure. Whether consciously or not, al-Sahili was creating a legacy — structures that would outlive him, that would be rebuilt and maintained by generations he would never know.

**Displacement:**
The experience of exile — of being permanently away from home, of building a life in a foreign land — might have shaped his character in ways the sources don't capture. Was he ever at peace in Mali, or always a stranger?

### Source Assessment

The evidence for al-Sahili's life is fragmentary and complicated by temporal distance:

**What is reasonably established:**
- Al-Sahili was a historical figure from Granada who accompanied Mansa Musa back from the hajj [P]
- He was known as a poet ("al-Tuwayjin") [P]
- He was highly valued by Musa (payment reported) [P]
- He spent the rest of his life in Mali (died c. 1346) [P]

**What is probable but less certain:**
- He was involved in architectural projects for Musa [P]
- He introduced or advanced fired-brick techniques [P]
- He was associated with the Djinguereber Mosque's construction [P]

**What rests on later tradition:**
- Specific buildings attributed to him (especially the Madugu palace) [T]
- Details of his architectural innovations [T]
- The legendary elaboration of his achievements over centuries [T]

**What is unknown:**
- His exact dates, family background, early career
- The specifics of his architectural education or training
- His life after Musa's death
- Any personal details (marriage, children, etc.)
- His poetry (none survives)
