## Overview

Muhammad al-Maghili was a North African Islamic scholar whose journey across the Sahara transformed the political and religious landscape of the western Sudan in the final decade of the fifteenth century. A Maliki jurist from Tlemcen who gained notoriety for inciting violence against the Jewish community of the Tuat oasis, al-Maghili subsequently traveled south into the Sahel, where he became the most influential foreign advisor to West African Muslim rulers of his era. His treatises on Islamic governance, written for Sultan Muhammad Rumfa of Kano and Askia Muhammad I of Songhai, established the theoretical framework for proper Islamic rule that would shape political thought in the region for centuries. [E]

Al-Maghili's legacy is irreducibly complex. On one hand, he was a learned jurist who provided West African rulers with sophisticated guidance on how to reconcile the demands of Islamic law with the realities of governing religiously diverse populations. His writings demonstrate deep engagement with the Maliki legal tradition and a genuine concern for the establishment of just governance according to Islamic principles. The questions his West African patrons posed — about taxation, the appointment of officials, the conduct of warfare, the treatment of religious syncretists — were practical governance problems, and al-Maghili's responses provided thoughtful frameworks for addressing them. His influence extended far beyond his lifetime: scholars cited his treatises for centuries, and the Sokoto jihad leaders of the early nineteenth century (outside this project's scope) invoked his authority to justify their reform movement. [E]

On the other hand, al-Maghili's career includes acts that cannot be ignored or minimized. His role in inciting violence against the Jewish community of Tuat — calling for the destruction of their synagogue and the termination of their protected (*dhimmi*) status — resulted in bloodshed and communal devastation. This was not an incidental episode but a defining moment in his career, one that preceded and perhaps motivated his departure southward. Any assessment of al-Maghili that omits or softens this violence fails to reckon with the full person. He was both a reformer who shaped African Islamic thought and a provocateur whose certainties proved deadly. The tension between these roles is not resolvable; it must simply be held. [E]

## Early Life and Background

### Origins in Tlemcen

Muhammad al-Maghili was born in Tlemcen, a major city of the central Maghreb (in modern northwestern Algeria), probably sometime between 1425 and 1440 CE. The precise date of his birth is unknown; estimates are derived from working backward from his death date of 1505 and assumptions about his age during his later activities. [P]

Tlemcen in the fifteenth century was a significant center of Islamic learning and commerce, the capital of the Zayyanid dynasty that ruled the central Maghreb. Though politically overshadowed by the Marinids of Fez to the west and the Hafsids of Tunis to the east, Tlemcen maintained a vibrant scholarly community and served as a commercial hub linking the Mediterranean world with the trans-Saharan trade routes. The city's *madrasas* (religious schools) trained scholars in the Maliki school of jurisprudence that predominated across North and West Africa. [P]

Al-Maghili received a thorough Islamic education in this environment. The sources do not preserve the names of his teachers, but his later writings demonstrate mastery of the standard Islamic sciences: Quranic exegesis (*tafsir*), prophetic traditions (*hadith*), jurisprudence (*fiqh*), Arabic grammar, and mystical thought (*tasawwuf*). He wrote in the classical Arabic of the educated scholarly class, and his treatises engage fluently with the authorities of the Maliki legal tradition. [P]

The nisba "al-Maghili" identifies him as belonging to a Berber group (the Banu Maghil or Maghrawa) from the western Maghreb, while "al-Tilimsani" marks his association with Tlemcen. These identifiers place him within the Berber scholarly networks that dominated trans-Saharan intellectual exchange. [P]

### Family and Lineage

Little is known about al-Maghili's family background. His father's name, Abd al-Karim, is preserved in his full name (Muhammad ibn Abd al-Karim), but nothing further about his ancestry appears in the sources. The absence of elaborate genealogical claims suggests that al-Maghili was not from a particularly distinguished scholarly lineage; his reputation rested on his own learning and activities rather than inherited status. [S]

Al-Maghili had at least one son, Abd al-Jabbar, who accompanied him on his travels to West Africa. Abd al-Jabbar would remain in the Sahel after his father's death, establishing a scholarly lineage in the region that continued for generations. Later scholars in the western Sudan traced their intellectual genealogy to the al-Maghili family, giving the scholar a posthumous institutional legacy beyond his writings. [P]

### Intellectual Formation

Al-Maghili's intellectual outlook combined several strands of Islamic thought that were in tension with each other — and with the religious pluralism that characterized both North and West African societies:

**Maliki Jurisprudence:** Al-Maghili was trained in the Maliki school, the dominant legal tradition of the western Islamic world. Maliki jurisprudence emphasizes the practices of the early Medinan community and tends toward conservatism in legal interpretation. Al-Maghili's legal opinions consistently cite Maliki authorities and frame questions within Maliki categories. [E]

**Rigorist Reform:** Al-Maghili belonged to a tendency within Islamic thought that emphasized strict adherence to religious law, the suppression of innovation (*bid'a*), and the purification of religious practice from non-Islamic accretions. This tendency was not unique to him — it recurred throughout Islamic history and would appear again in later reform movements — but al-Maghili was among its more extreme representatives in his time. [P]

**Sufism:** Despite his rigorist legal positions, al-Maghili also engaged with Islamic mysticism (*tasawwuf*). He wrote a commentary on mystical texts, and his correspondence suggests familiarity with Sufi concepts. This combination of legalism and mysticism was not unusual in the Islamic scholarly tradition — many jurists were also Sufi practitioners — but it complicates any simple characterization of al-Maghili as merely a rigid legalist. [P]

**Millenarian Undertones:** Some scholars have detected millenarian themes in al-Maghili's thought, a sense that the Islamic community was in a state of crisis requiring urgent purification. The approaching Islamic millennium (the year 1000 AH, corresponding to 1591 CE) may have heightened expectations of religious renewal. Al-Maghili did not make explicit millennial claims, but his urgency about reform fits a broader pattern of late-fifteenth-century Islamic reformist thought. [S]

## The Tuat Affair

### Context: Jewish Communities in the Saharan Oases

The Tuat oasis complex, located in the central Sahara (in modern southern Algeria), served as a crucial waystation on the trans-Saharan trade routes connecting North Africa with the Sahel. Caravans passing through Tuat might be traveling to Timbuktu, Gao, or the Hausa cities, carrying Mediterranean goods southward and returning with gold, enslaved people, and other commodities from sub-Saharan Africa. [E]

Tuat hosted a Jewish community that had existed for centuries, engaged primarily in commerce and crafts. These Jews occupied the legal status of *dhimmis* — protected non-Muslims who, under Islamic law, were permitted to practice their religion in exchange for payment of the *jizya* (poll tax) and acceptance of various social restrictions. The *dhimmi* system, while discriminatory by modern standards, had historically provided a framework for Jewish and Christian communities to live and worship within Islamic polities. The Jews of Tuat had their own synagogue and maintained their religious practices under this arrangement. [P]

Jewish communities in Saharan oases were not unusual. Similar populations existed in other North African locations, and Jews had participated in trans-Saharan commerce for centuries. Their presence in Tuat was long-established and, until al-Maghili's intervention, apparently unremarkable. [P]

### Al-Maghili's Campaign

Sometime in the late 1480s or early 1490s — the precise chronology is debated — al-Maghili arrived in Tuat and began agitating against the Jewish community. His arguments were legal and theological: he contended that the Jews of Tuat had forfeited their protected status through alleged violations of the *dhimma* (the contract of protection). Specifically, he accused them of exceeding the social restrictions that Islamic law traditionally imposed on *dhimmis*, and he argued that their continued presence and prosperity were an affront to Islam. [E]

The central demand of al-Maghili's campaign was the destruction of a recently constructed synagogue. Al-Maghili argued that Islamic law prohibited *dhimmis* from building new places of worship and that the synagogue in Tuat had been constructed in violation of this principle. He called for its demolition. [E]

Al-Maghili's campaign was not universally supported among North African scholars. He engaged in a documented legal dispute with Muhammad ibn Asfiyush, another Maliki jurist, who defended the traditional interpretation of *dhimmi* protections and opposed the destruction of the synagogue. The debate demonstrates that al-Maghili's extreme position was contested within the Islamic scholarly community — his views were not normative but rigorist. [E]

### Violence and Its Consequences

Al-Maghili prevailed. The synagogue was destroyed, and the Jewish community of Tuat suffered violence that may have included deaths, though the sources are not precise about the scale of the bloodshed. Some accounts suggest that Jews were killed; others describe the community being driven out or forced to convert. The exact casualty count is not preserved, but the destruction of the synagogue and the communal devastation are well documented. [E]

The Tuat affair reveals al-Maghili at his most dangerous: a scholar whose certainty in his legal interpretations justified violence against a vulnerable minority community. His arguments were framed in Islamic legal language, drawing on precedents and authorities, but they represented an extreme reading of the *dhimmi* system that other jurists rejected. The violence in Tuat was not an aberration in his career but a logical consequence of his rigorist program — the application of his ideas to a concrete situation with devastating results. [E]

### Departure Southward

Following the Tuat affair, al-Maghili traveled southward across the Sahara into the western Sudan. The reasons for his departure are not entirely clear. Some scholars suggest he was fleeing the controversy his actions had generated; others propose that he was motivated by a positive desire to spread Islamic learning and reform to regions perceived as religiously underdeveloped. It is also possible that he had already been in contact with West African rulers who sought scholarly guidance and was responding to invitations. [D]

Whatever his motives, al-Maghili's journey across the Sahara was extraordinary. The crossing was dangerous, requiring weeks of travel through hostile desert terrain with limited water and the ever-present threat of Tuareg raids. That he undertook this journey suggests powerful motivation — whether flight, mission, or opportunity. [P]

## Advisory Role in Hausaland: Muhammad Rumfa

### Arrival in Kano

Al-Maghili arrived in Kano, one of the major Hausa city-states, sometime in the 1490s — traditionally dated to approximately 1493, though the precise year is uncertain. Kano under Sultan Muhammad Rumfa (r. 1463-1499) was undergoing a systematic program of Islamic reform, and Rumfa actively sought guidance from learned scholars on how to properly implement Islamic governance. The arrival of a respected North African jurist offered exactly the kind of authoritative counsel Rumfa desired. [E]

The Kano Chronicle, our principal source for Rumfa's reign, lists the consultation with al-Maghili as one of the ruler's twelve major innovations (*gina gari*). This listing demonstrates how significant later Hausa historical memory considered the consultation to be — it was not merely an incident but a defining moment in Kano's transformation into an Islamic state. [P]

### The Questions and the Treatise

Al-Maghili's sojourn in Kano produced a treatise known as *Taj al-Din fima Yajib ala al-Muluk* ("The Crown of Religion Concerning the Obligations of Princes"). This work takes the form of questions posed by Rumfa and responses provided by al-Maghili, addressing fundamental issues of Islamic governance:

**The Qualifications of the Ruler:** What makes a legitimate Muslim sovereign? Al-Maghili outlined the classical requirements — knowledge of Islamic law, personal piety, capacity for administration, justice in dealing with subjects — while acknowledging that finding a ruler who perfectly met all criteria was difficult in practice. He emphasized that the ruler's primary obligation was to implement God's law, making the sovereign a trustee rather than an absolute owner of authority. [E]

**The Appointment of Officials:** How should a Muslim ruler select his advisors, judges, and administrators? Al-Maghili stressed the importance of appointing officials based on their religious knowledge and moral character rather than birth or favoritism. He particularly emphasized the need for qualified *qadis* (judges) to administer Islamic law and for officials who would advise the ruler honestly rather than merely tell him what he wished to hear. [E]

**The Treatment of Religious Syncretists:** What should be done about subjects who claimed to be Muslim but continued to practice indigenous religion, or who mixed Islam with non-Islamic elements? This was perhaps the most pressing question for rulers in the western Sudan, where Islam existed alongside and often blended with indigenous religious traditions. Al-Maghili's response was rigorous: those who practiced religious syncretism were to be treated as apostates if they had once been true Muslims, or as unbelievers if they had never properly accepted Islam. They should be called to repentance, but if they persisted, harsher measures were appropriate. [E]

**Taxation and Public Finance:** What constituted legitimate taxation under Islamic law? Al-Maghili distinguished between the forms of taxation sanctioned by Islamic jurisprudence — *zakat* (alms tax), *jizya* (poll tax on non-Muslims), and trade levies — and illegitimate exactions. He cautioned rulers against oppressive taxation while acknowledging the state's need for revenue. [E]

**The Conduct of Jihad:** When was religious warfare obligatory, and how should it be conducted? Al-Maghili provided guidance on the circumstances justifying jihad, the treatment of prisoners and conquered peoples, and the distribution of spoils. His framework assumed that rulers in the western Sudan were surrounded by non-Muslim or nominally Muslim populations against whom military action might be required. [E]

### Implementation and Influence

How thoroughly Rumfa implemented al-Maghili's recommendations cannot be determined with certainty. The Kano Chronicle credits him with establishing Shari'a courts, building mosques, and reforming state institutions, but the sources do not allow us to trace the specific influence of the *Taj al-Din* on particular policies. What is clear is that al-Maghili's treatise became an authoritative reference for later generations — scholars cited it for centuries as a foundational statement of Islamic political theory in the West African context. [P]

The relationship between al-Maghili and Rumfa appears to have been one of mutual benefit. Al-Maghili gained an audience for his teachings and the patronage of a powerful ruler; Rumfa gained religious legitimacy and practical guidance for his reform program. The treatise that resulted was not an abstract academic exercise but a practical handbook for governance, shaped by the specific questions and challenges that Rumfa faced. [P]

## Advisory Role in Songhai: Askia Muhammad I

### From Kano to Gao

After his time in Hausaland, al-Maghili traveled westward to the Songhai Empire, arriving at the court of Askia Muhammad I at Gao. The Askia had seized power in 1493, overthrowing the Sunni dynasty in a religiously framed coup, and was deeply invested in establishing his legitimacy as a proper Islamic ruler. He had already made the pilgrimage to Mecca (1496-1497), where he reportedly received the title "Caliph of the Sudan" from the Abbasid caliph in Cairo. Now he sought the guidance of a learned jurist on how to govern according to Islamic principles. [E]

The encounter between Askia Muhammad and al-Maghili was one of the most significant intellectual exchanges in West African history. Here was the ruler of the largest state in sub-Saharan Africa, freshly returned from hajj and eager to implement Islamic governance, meeting with a jurist who had spent his career thinking about exactly these questions. The combination was potent. [P]

### The Askia's Questions

The questions Askia Muhammad posed to al-Maghili, and al-Maghili's responses, were collected in a work known as the *Ajwiba* ("Replies" or "Answers"). These questions reveal the practical challenges facing a ruler who sought to govern Islamically in a society where Islam coexisted with indigenous religious traditions:

**On Syncretism and Folk Religion:** What should be done about subjects who practiced Islamic observances (prayer, fasting) while also consulting indigenous religious specialists, making offerings at shrines, or participating in ceremonies that mixed Islamic and non-Islamic elements? This was the central religious challenge facing Sahelian rulers. Al-Maghili's response was uncompromising: such people were not true Muslims, and the ruler was obligated to suppress their practices through persuasion and, if necessary, force. [E]

**On the Scholars' Independence:** What was the proper relationship between the ruler and the *ulama* (religious scholars)? Al-Maghili affirmed the scholars' independence in matters of religious interpretation while also emphasizing their duty to advise the ruler. The tension between royal authority and scholarly independence was perennial in Islamic states, and al-Maghili tried to balance the ruler's need for guidance against the scholars' need for autonomy. [E]

**On Markets and Commerce:** How should commercial activity be regulated according to Islamic principles? Al-Maghili provided guidance on the appointment of market inspectors (*muhtasib*), the enforcement of fair weights and measures, the prohibition of usury, and the regulation of trades deemed immoral. [E]

**On War and Captives:** Similar to his advice for Rumfa, al-Maghili addressed the conditions for legitimate warfare and the treatment of those captured in war. Given that Songhai's economy depended partly on the slave trade, these questions had immediate practical implications. [E]

### The Scope of Reform

Al-Maghili's advice to Askia Muhammad was in some respects more demanding than what he had provided to Rumfa. He pushed for a more rigorous suppression of religious syncretism and a more thorough implementation of Islamic legal institutions. Whether this reflected the different political circumstances — Songhai was larger and more powerful, with a ruler who had more capacity to implement reform — or al-Maghili's own evolving views is uncertain. [P]

The *Tarikh al-Sudan* and *Tarikh al-Fattash*, the major Songhai-era chronicles, portray al-Maghili's visit as a pivotal moment in Askia Muhammad's reign. The chronicles, written by scholars connected to Timbuktu's scholarly establishment, had every reason to celebrate a figure who emphasized the authority of Islamic learning and the importance of scholarly guidance for rulers. Their positive portrayal of al-Maghili should be read with this interest in mind, though it does not diminish the historical significance of his visit. [P]

---

## Teachings and Treatises

### The Corpus of Works

Al-Maghili was a prolific writer whose works span several genres:

**Political and Legal Treatises:** The *Taj al-Din* (for Rumfa) and *Ajwiba* (for Askia Muhammad) are his most historically significant works, providing detailed guidance on Islamic governance in the West African context. These treatises circulated widely in manuscript form and were copied and cited for centuries. [E]

**Anti-Jewish Polemics:** Al-Maghili composed works justifying his campaign against the Jews of Tuat, arguing on legal and theological grounds that their *dhimmi* protections had been forfeited. These texts document his reasoning during the Tuat affair. [E]

**Sufi and Mystical Works:** Despite his rigorist legal positions, al-Maghili engaged with Islamic mysticism. His *Misbah al-Arwah* ("Lamp of Souls") is a mystical commentary that demonstrates familiarity with Sufi concepts and terminology. The combination of legalism and mysticism was not unusual in the Islamic scholarly tradition, but it complicates any portrayal of al-Maghili as merely a rigid jurist. [P]

**Occasional Writings:** Al-Maghili composed responses to various legal questions, sermons, and other occasional pieces that circulated in the scholarly networks of North and West Africa. [P]

### Theological and Legal Positions

Al-Maghili's thought can be characterized by several consistent themes:

**Strict Monotheism (Tawhid):** Al-Maghili emphasized the absolute oneness of God and the prohibition of associating anything with divine status. This translated into hostility toward any practice that seemed to attribute special powers to objects, places, or persons other than God — including the veneration of shrines, consultation of non-Islamic religious specialists, and various folk practices common in West African Islam. [E]

**The Ruler's Religious Obligation:** Al-Maghili conceived of the Muslim ruler as having active responsibility to implement Islamic law and suppress error. The ruler was not merely a political figure but a religious trustee whose legitimacy depended on fulfilling this role. This conception placed heavy burdens on rulers while also giving them religious justification for extensive intervention in their subjects' religious lives. [E]

**Categorization of Peoples:** Al-Maghili was concerned with properly classifying the populations rulers governed. True Muslims, proper *dhimmis*, unbelievers, apostates, and religious syncretists each required different treatment under Islamic law. Much of his advice concerned how to identify which category particular groups or individuals belonged to and what policies were appropriate for each. [E]

**Anti-Innovation (*Bid'a*):** Like many Islamic reformers, al-Maghili opposed religious innovations that departed from the practice of the Prophet and the early Muslim community. Many of the practices he criticized — shrine veneration, syncretic ceremonies, the use of non-Islamic religious specialists — fell under the category of reprehensible innovation in his view. [E]

## Later Years and Death

### Return to the Maghreb

After his time in West Africa — which may have extended over several years or even a decade — al-Maghili returned to the Maghreb. The circumstances of his return are not well documented. Some accounts suggest he died in Tuat, the site of his earlier anti-Jewish campaign; others place his death in Tlemcen or elsewhere in North Africa. [D]

Al-Maghili died in 1505 CE (corresponding to approximately 910 AH in the Islamic calendar). He would have been in his sixties or seventies, depending on which birth date estimate is accepted. The *Tarikh al-Sudan* records his death and notes that he was buried in either Tuat or Tlemcen. [P]

### His Son Abd al-Jabbar

Al-Maghili's son Abd al-Jabbar remained in West Africa after his father's departure. He established himself as a scholar in the Sahel, transmitting his father's teachings to the next generation and founding a scholarly lineage that persisted for centuries. Through Abd al-Jabbar and his descendants, al-Maghili's intellectual legacy was institutionalized in West Africa, independent of the continuing circulation of his written works. [P]

The al-Maghili family became part of the scholarly establishment of the western Sudan, intermarrying with local learned families and contributing to the region's intellectual life. This biological and institutional continuity meant that al-Maghili's influence extended far beyond what his writings alone might have achieved. [P]

---

## Legacy and Historical Impact

### Immediate Impact

Al-Maghili's immediate impact was significant. His treatises provided Muhammad Rumfa and Askia Muhammad I with authoritative guidance for their reform programs. The questions they posed and the answers he provided shaped specific policies regarding courts, taxation, warfare, and the treatment of religious minorities. Both rulers cited his authority in implementing changes that transformed their states. [E]

In Kano, the *Taj al-Din* became a foundational text for political thought. Rumfa's successors governed within the framework that the treatise established, even when they fell short of its ideals. Scholars continued to copy and study the text, making it part of the standard curriculum for those interested in Islamic governance. [P]

In Songhai, al-Maghili's advice reinforced Askia Muhammad's already-strong inclination toward Islamic reform. The Askia's patronage of Timbuktu's scholarly community, his establishment of qadi courts, and his efforts to suppress religious syncretism all aligned with al-Maghili's recommendations. Whether these policies would have been pursued without al-Maghili's intervention cannot be known, but his presence certainly provided religious sanction for the Askia's program. [P]

### Long-term Influence

Al-Maghili's influence extended far beyond his lifetime. His treatises circulated in manuscript form across West Africa for centuries, and subsequent generations of scholars cited his authority on questions of Islamic governance. Two particularly significant later developments drew heavily on his legacy:

**The Sokoto Jihad (1804):** When Usman dan Fodio and his followers launched their reform movement in Hausaland — outside this project's scope but worth noting — they explicitly invoked al-Maghili's authority. The Sokoto jihadists cited his treatises, particularly his pronouncements on the illegitimacy of syncretic religious practice and the ruler's obligation to enforce Islamic law. Al-Maghili's writings provided legal and theological justification for their campaign against Hausa rulers they deemed insufficiently Islamic. [E]

**Intellectual Tradition:** Generations of West African scholars engaged with al-Maghili's writings as part of their education. Agreeing with, criticizing, or extending his arguments became part of the scholarly conversation in the region. His works were not merely historical curiosities but living texts that shaped ongoing debates about the relationship between Islam, governance, and society. [P]

### A Complex Legacy

Any assessment of al-Maghili's legacy must reckon with its complexity. He was simultaneously:

**A Significant Islamic Thinker:** His treatises represent sophisticated applications of Islamic legal reasoning to the specific challenges of governance in the western Sudan. He took seriously the questions his patrons posed and provided thoughtful responses grounded in the Maliki tradition. Later scholars benefited from his work regardless of whether they agreed with his conclusions. [E]

**A Promoter of Violence:** His campaign against the Jews of Tuat resulted in bloodshed and communal destruction. Whatever the legal arguments he marshaled, the practical effect was the devastation of a vulnerable minority community. This violence was not incidental to his career but flowed directly from his rigorist convictions. [E]

**An Advocate of Religious Coercion:** Al-Maghili's advice to African rulers consistently emphasized the suppression of religious practices he deemed unacceptable. While he generally advocated persuasion before force, force remained on the table. His framework justified the state's intervention in its subjects' religious lives in ways that could and did lead to coercion. [E]

**A Vehicle of Islamic Learning:** Whatever his personal characteristics, al-Maghili transmitted the accumulated learning of the Islamic scholarly tradition to West Africa. Through his treatises, his teaching, and his descendants, he connected the Sahel with the wider intellectual world of Sunni Islam. [E]

These different aspects of his legacy cannot be easily reconciled. Al-Maghili was not a figure who can be simply celebrated or condemned. He shaped West African history in profound ways, and that shaping included both intellectual enrichment and the promotion of religious violence. His legacy is instructive precisely because it resists simplification.

## Scholarly Debates

| Question | Position A | Position B | Current Consensus |
|----------|------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Tuat chronology** | Violence occurred c. 1490-1492, before West African travels | Chronology uncertain; may have overlapped with travels | [D] Most scholars place Tuat before West Africa, but dating is imprecise |
| **Motivation for West African travel** | Flight from controversy following Tuat affair | Positive missionary motivation to spread reform | [D] Likely mixed motives; evidence supports both elements |
| **Implementation of advice** | Rumfa and Askia Muhammad fully implemented al-Maghili's recommendations | Treatises represent ideals; actual implementation was partial | [P] Likely some implementation, but full rigor was impractical |
| **Religious sincerity vs. political calculation** | Al-Maghili was genuinely motivated by religious conviction | His actions served political and personal interests | [D] False dichotomy; religious conviction and political interest coexisted |
| **Influence on later jihad movements** | Direct intellectual lineage to Sokoto and other reform movements | Later movements developed independently; al-Maghili was post-hoc justification | [P] Genuine influence, though later movements had their own dynamics |

### The Question of Millenarianism

Some scholars have detected millenarian themes in al-Maghili's thought — a sense that the Islamic community was approaching a crisis requiring urgent purification. The year 1000 AH (corresponding to 1591 CE) was approaching during al-Maghili's lifetime, and expectations of religious renewal at the turn of the Islamic millennium were present in some quarters of the Muslim world. Whether al-Maghili's urgency about reform reflected such millenarian expectations, or whether his rigorism had other sources, remains debated. [D]

### The Question of Consistency

Scholars have noted apparent tensions within al-Maghili's thought — between his legalism and his Sufism, between his theoretical positions and what was practically implementable, between his advice to different rulers. Some interpret these tensions as evidence of intellectual evolution over his career; others see them as evidence that he adapted his advice to different contexts and audiences. The question of how to read the consistency (or inconsistency) of his corpus remains open. [D]

## For Fiction Writing

### Dramatic Potential

**Fiction Potential: HIGH**

Muhammad al-Maghili offers exceptional material for fiction exploring the intersection of ideas and power, conviction and violence, learning and fanaticism. He was a complex figure whose certainties produced both sophisticated legal reasoning and lethal consequences. A fictional treatment could explore:

**The Traveling Scholar:** Al-Maghili's journey — from the scholarly centers of Tlemcen, to the oases of the Sahara, across the desert to the courts of the western Sudan — is itself a dramatic arc. The physical hardship of Saharan crossing, the cultural encounters at each stop, the scholar carrying his books and his convictions across a vast landscape: these offer rich scene-setting opportunities.

**The Dangerous Idea:** What happens when ideas have consequences? Al-Maghili's certainties about religious law translated into violence in Tuat and policies of coercion in the Sahel. A fiction could explore how a sincere believer arrives at conclusions that justify harming others, the psychology of religious conviction pushed to extremes.

**The Royal Consultation:** The scenes between al-Maghili and his royal patrons — Rumfa in Kano, Askia Muhammad in Gao — offer opportunities for intellectual dialogue dramatized. What does it look like when a ruler asks a scholar how to govern justly, and the scholar answers? The dynamic between temporal power and religious authority, each needing the other, is rich material.

**The Question of Legacy:** How does a historical figure live on after death? Al-Maghili's writings circulated for centuries, cited by scholars and reformers who never knew him. What does it mean to launch ideas into the world that will shape events you cannot foresee?

### Sensory World

**The Maghreb:**
- Tlemcen: a walled city of whitewashed buildings and tiled mosques, the smell of leatherworking and metalworking from the artisan quarters, the sound of the call to prayer echoing across flat rooftops, fountains in courtyard gardens, the dry heat of summer and chill of winter nights
- Scholars in turbans and flowing robes, gathered in mosque courtyards or madrasa classrooms, voices reciting texts, the scratch of reed pens on paper
- Markets selling books, ink, and paper alongside cloth, spices, and metalwork
- The view from the city walls: orchards in the valleys below, mountains rising in the distance

**The Saharan Crossing:**
- The endless expanse of sand and gravel, the sky enormous and hard blue
- The rhythm of camel travel: swaying motion, the creak of saddles, the grunt and bellow of the animals
- Oases: impossible green against the brown, the relief of shade and water, date palms rustling
- Night in the desert: cold, stars impossibly bright, the sounds of the camp — animals shifting, prayers being offered, conversations in low voices
- The dangers: thirst, sandstorms, the fear of raiding parties
- Tuat: the oasis town where everything changed, the synagogue before and after, the faces of those he condemned

**The Western Sudan:**
- Kano: the massive mud-brick walls rising from the savanna, the gates crowded with traders, the smell of indigo from the dye-pits, the covered arcades of the Kurmi market
- Gao: the Niger River wide and brown, boats carrying goods, the royal compound where the Askia holds court, the mosque with its distinctive pyramidal minaret
- The heat: different from the Maghreb, wetter, the feeling of air that holds moisture
- The sounds: drums announcing royal processions, the call to prayer from mud-brick minarets, languages he does not fully understand — Hausa, Songhai — mixed with the Arabic of the educated
- The court audience: the ruler on his dais, courtiers prostrating, the scholar seated in a place of honor, presenting his advice

### Speech and Voice

**Formal Arabic:** Al-Maghili spoke and wrote in classical Arabic, the language of Islamic scholarship. His speech to rulers would be formal, punctuated with Quranic quotations and references to prophetic hadith. He would use the elaborate formulas of scholarly discourse, framing his advice as the transmission of established learning rather than personal opinion.

**Modes of Address:**
- "O Commander of the Faithful" or "O Sultan" to rulers
- "My son" or "Brother in faith" to students and fellow scholars
- Heavy use of "In sha'Allah" (God willing), "Alhamdulillah" (praise be to God), and similar pious formulas

**Rhetorical Style:**
- Arguments built from Quranic verses and hadith, citing authorities by name
- Careful qualifications and distinctions (between different categories of people, different circumstances, different rulings)
- A tone of certainty: this is not speculation but the clear teaching of Islamic law
- Possibly flashes of impatience or anger when challenged or when confronting what he saw as obvious error

**Dialogue Opportunities:**
- Debating Ibn Asfiyush about the Jews of Tuat: two scholars with access to the same tradition reaching opposite conclusions
- Answering Muhammad Rumfa's questions: the practical ruler seeking guidance, the scholar trying to apply abstract principles to concrete situations
- Advising Askia Muhammad on syncretism: the tension between the ideal and the implementable
- A private moment: al-Maghili at prayer, or reflecting on his life's work, revealing what drove him beneath the formal discourse

### Key Relationships

**Ibn Asfiyush:** The scholar who opposed him at Tuat. Their debate was not merely academic but had life-and-death stakes. What was their relationship before the dispute? Were they colleagues, acquaintances, strangers? How did each view the other after the violence?

**Muhammad Rumfa:** The reforming sultan who sought his guidance. What did each man think of the other? Did Rumfa accept all of al-Maghili's advice, or did he push back on impractical recommendations? Was there warmth between them, or merely the formality of scholar and patron?

**Askia Muhammad I:** An even more powerful ruler, a hajji who styled himself Caliph of the Sudan. The dynamic between them would have been different from the Kano relationship — the Askia had his own strong convictions and religious credentials. Was al-Maghili ever intimidated by royal power, or did he maintain scholarly independence?

**Abd al-Jabbar:** His son, who accompanied him and stayed in West Africa. What was their relationship? Did the son share his father's convictions entirely, or did he have doubts? What did he make of his father's legacy?

**The Jewish Community of Tuat:** We have no names, no individual portraits, only the collective noun. For fiction, giving faces and voices to those al-Maghili targeted would be essential for a full portrait — the victims of certainty.

### Scene Opportunities

1. **The Debate at Tuat:** Al-Maghili and Ibn Asfiyush, two scholars citing the same authorities, reaching opposite conclusions. The audience of local officials who must decide which to follow. The building tension as it becomes clear that lives hang on the outcome.

2. **The Morning After:** Al-Maghili the morning after the synagogue's destruction, the violence accomplished. What does he see? What does he feel? Satisfaction? Doubt? How does he understand what he has done?

3. **The Saharan Crossing:** Al-Maghili and his son in the desert, facing the physical reality of the journey. A moment of vulnerability, perhaps illness or thirst, that strips away scholarly authority. Conversation between father and son about why they are doing this.

4. **First Audience with Rumfa:** The scholar arriving at an unfamiliar court, seeking to establish his authority. Rumfa testing him with questions. The moment when trust is established (or not).

5. **The Hard Question:** A question that exposes the gap between the ideal and the real — perhaps about a specific case where strict application of al-Maghili's advice would cause obvious harm. How does he respond?

6. **Night in Gao:** Al-Maghili walking through the streets of a city utterly unlike his homeland. The smells, sounds, and sights of West Africa. A moment of alienation or wonder.

7. **The Last Conversation with Askia Muhammad:** The scholar preparing to leave, the ruler who has received his advice. What passes between them? Gratitude? Unfinished business? Advice for the future?

8. **Return to Tuat:** If the traditions placing his death there are correct, al-Maghili returned to the site of his greatest violence. What did it feel like to return? Had anything changed? Was the Jewish community still devastated, or had some remnant survived?

9. **Dictating the Treatise:** Al-Maghili composing the *Taj al-Din* or the *Ajwiba*, working through the questions and formulating his responses. The craft of scholarship, the choices about what to include and what to leave out.

10. **A Student Reads:** Years after al-Maghili's death, a young scholar in Timbuktu or Kano studying his treatise. What does he make of the long-dead scholar's advice? The persistence of ideas.

### Worldview and Values

**Certainty:** Al-Maghili appears to have had great confidence in his interpretations of Islamic law. This certainty gave him the ability to act decisively — to call for violence, to advise rulers, to condemn practices he found objectionable. Whether this certainty was a strength or a flaw depends on perspective; it was certainly a defining characteristic.

**The Scholar's Authority:** Al-Maghili believed that scholars had an essential role in guiding society and that their judgments on religious matters should shape policy. This belief led him to seek audiences with rulers and to compose treatises intended to influence governance.

**Religious Purity:** The obsession with distinguishing true Islam from syncretism, innovation, and deviation runs through al-Maghili's work. He saw himself as defending authentic religion against corruption — a stance that could produce both scholarly rigor and intolerance.

**Obligation to Act:** Al-Maghili was not content to merely hold correct opinions; he believed in implementing them. This activist orientation drove both his violence and his reformist advising. Quietism was not an option for him.

**Categories and Boundaries:** Much of al-Maghili's intellectual work involved defining categories — Muslim, non-Muslim, *dhimmi*, apostate, syncretist — and drawing boundaries between them. This taxonomic impulse shaped both his legal reasoning and his policies toward different groups.

### Source Assessment

The primary sources for al-Maghili are exceptionally good by medieval African standards. His own writings survive in manuscript copies and have been translated by modern scholars. The chronicles of both Hausaland and Songhai record his visits, and later scholarly tradition preserved memories of his influence.

The main limitations are:

- **Dating imprecision:** The exact chronology of al-Maghili's travels is uncertain, with different sources suggesting different dates.
- **Perspective of sources:** The Timbuktu chronicles were written by scholars who had reasons to praise a figure who emphasized scholarly authority; their positive portrayal should be read with this interest in mind.
- **Silence on personal life:** We know little about al-Maghili as a person beyond his intellectual work — his personality, private thoughts, and relationships are largely opaque.
- **The Tuat affair:** While the basic facts are established, the precise scale of the violence and the detailed chronology remain uncertain.
