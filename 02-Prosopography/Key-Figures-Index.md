## Notes on Sources and Gaps

### Best-Documented Figures
The figures with the richest source material are those described in Arabic chronicles or Ethiopian Ge'ez texts: Mansa Musa, Sundiata (oral tradition), Askia Muhammad, Ezana (inscriptions), and the Ethiopian emperors. Ibn Battuta's account provides vivid eyewitness detail for Mansa Sulayman's court and the Swahili Coast sultans.

### Most Challenging Gaps
- **Great Zimbabwe rulers:** No written records survive; names are not securely known
- **Pre-Islamic Ghana rulers:** Known only through fragmentary Arabic reports and oral tradition
- **Swahili Coast rulers before c. 1200:** Very thin record before archaeological and Arabic evidence converges
- **Women's lives:** Outside of Queen Amina, Gudit, Queen Mother Idia, and Nzinga Mbande, women are severely underrepresented in the sources — but this reflects source bias, not absence of important women

### Figures Just Outside Project Scope (For Cross-Reference)
- **Shaka Zulu** (c. 1787-1828) — Too late for this project but important precursor traditions exist
- **Nzinga Mbande** (c. 1583-1663) — Included above as she overlaps our period slightly
- **Menelik II** (r. 1889-1913) — Modern Ethiopia; separate project
- **Ancient Kushite rulers** (pre-300 CE) — Covered in Ancient_Egypt project context
