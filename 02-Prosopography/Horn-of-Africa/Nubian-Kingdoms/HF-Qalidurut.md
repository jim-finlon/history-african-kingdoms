## Overview

Qalidurut stands as one of the most consequential military commanders in African history, yet his name remains largely unknown outside specialized scholarship. In 651-652 CE, this Nubian general achieved what no other commander in the known world accomplished during that era: he stopped the Arab conquests. While the Sassanid Persian Empire collapsed entirely before Muslim armies, while the Byzantine Empire lost Egypt, Syria, Palestine, and North Africa, while Visigothic Spain would soon fall, Christian Nubia — under Qalidurut's military leadership — not only repelled Arab invasion but forced the Islamic caliphate to negotiate as equals.

The result was the Baqt (from Latin *pactum*), a treaty unique in the history of early Islamic expansion. [E] Where elsewhere the Arabs offered conquered peoples three choices — conversion, tributary status under Muslim rule, or continued war — Nubia received something unprecedented: recognition as an independent non-Muslim polity with which the Islamic state maintained formal diplomatic and trade relations. This treaty would preserve Nubian Christian independence for over six centuries, making it one of the most successful diplomatic instruments in medieval history.

Qalidurut's achievement cannot be attributed to luck, geography, or Arab disinterest. The Arab armies that invaded Nubia were the same forces that had conquered Egypt with stunning efficiency. They came with the confidence of soldiers who had shattered two empires in a decade. What they encountered in Nubia was a military system built around the most feared archers of the medieval world — the *rumat al-hadaq*, the "eye-smiters" — and a commander capable of deploying that advantage to devastating effect. The Arabs arrived expecting conquest; they left having experienced something they had rarely encountered: defeat.

## Historical Context

### The World in 651 CE

To understand Qalidurut's achievement, one must grasp the extraordinary military situation of the mid-seventh century.

**The Arab Conquests:** In the two decades following the death of the Prophet Muhammad in 632 CE, Arab Muslim armies achieved one of the most dramatic military expansions in world history. [E] The Sassanid Persian Empire — a great power that had contested with Rome and Byzantium for centuries — was conquered in its entirety. The Byzantine Empire lost its richest provinces: Syria (634-638), Palestine (637-640), and Egypt (639-642). North Africa would follow. By 651, when the Arabs turned their attention to Nubia, they had compiled an almost unbroken record of victory.

**Why the Arabs Won:** The Arab victories were not merely religious enthusiasm or superior numbers. [P] They reflected:
- Military innovation: light cavalry tactics suited to open terrain
- Strategic mobility: the ability to strike faster than enemies could respond
- Political collapse of opponents: both Persia and Byzantium were exhausted from their own wars
- Motivated leadership: commanders with personal stakes in conquest
- Unity of purpose: a shared religious vision that bound diverse tribal forces

**The Conquest of Egypt (639-642):** Egypt's fall was particularly relevant to Nubia. [E] In less than three years, Arab forces under Amr ibn al-As conquered the wealthiest province of the Byzantine Empire. The great city of Alexandria, repository of classical learning and seat of the Coptic patriarch, submitted in 642. Egypt's Coptic Christian population, alienated from their Byzantine Greek overlords by theological disputes and heavy taxation, offered limited resistance. Many viewed the Arabs as liberators from Byzantine oppression — a calculation that would prove tragically short-sighted.

**The Nubian Frontier:** With Egypt secured, the Arab commanders looked south. [P] The Nile corridor led directly into Nubia, where Christian kingdoms had existed since the sixth century. The wealth of Nubia — gold, ivory, enslaved people, and exotic goods from the African interior — beckoned. More practically, Nubia could serve as a staging ground for further African expansion. Arab raiding parties probed southward, testing Nubian defenses.

### The Nubian Kingdoms

**Makuria:** The primary Nubian kingdom was Makuria, centered on Old Dongola (Nubian: Tungul) on the Nile's east bank. [E] Makuria had converted to Christianity in the mid-sixth century, initially adopting the Chalcedonian (Byzantine) form before shifting to the Miaphysite (Coptic) tradition. By the 640s, Makuria was a mature Christian state with an established church hierarchy, literate administration, and military tradition.

**Nobatia:** To the north lay Nobatia, the smaller Nubian kingdom occupying Lower Nubia (between the First and Second Cataracts). Nobatia had converted to Christianity slightly before Makuria, adopting the Miaphysite tradition from the start. [P] The relationship between Nobatia and Makuria in this period is unclear — they may have been independent kingdoms, or Nobatia may already have been a Makurian vassal or dependency. The two kingdoms would merge (perhaps as a result of the Arab threat) sometime in the mid-seventh century.

**Alodia:** South of Makuria, the kingdom of Alodia centered on Soba near the confluence of the Blue and White Niles. Alodia had also converted to Christianity (c. 580 CE). [P] Its role in the resistance to Arab invasion is unclear, though it may have provided support to its northern neighbors.

**Nubian Military Tradition:** The Nubian kingdoms had developed a distinctive military system centered on archery. [E] Nubian archers were renowned throughout the Mediterranean and Middle Eastern worlds. Egyptian, Byzantine, and Arab sources all attest to their skill. The bow was the primary weapon, and Nubian archers trained from childhood to achieve extraordinary accuracy. This was not a primitive military system but a sophisticated one, developed over centuries and adapted to the terrain and tactical requirements of the Nile valley.

## The First Arab Invasion (641 CE)

### The Probe

In 641 CE — even before Egypt's conquest was complete — Arab forces conducted their first military operation into Nubian territory. [E] This was a reconnaissance in force, testing Nubian defenses and gathering intelligence for potential full-scale invasion.

**The Arab Force:** The expedition was likely a cavalry raiding party of moderate size, perhaps a few hundred to a few thousand men. [S] Arab tactics of this period favored mobile cavalry forces that could strike quickly, defeat local resistance, and either consolidate gains or withdraw before enemy reinforcements arrived. This formula had worked spectacularly across Persia and the Levant.

**The Nubian Response:** What the Arabs encountered was unlike anything they had faced in Egypt. [P] The Nubian archers — organized, disciplined, and fighting on home ground — engaged the Arab cavalry with devastating effect. Nubian archery was not merely effective; it was terrifying. Arab soldiers, accustomed to facing Byzantine infantry and Persian cavalry, found themselves targeted by archers of extraordinary precision.

### The "Eye-Smiters" (Rumat al-Hadaq)

The Arab withdrawal from this first invasion produced one of the most vivid epithets in medieval military history. The Nubian archers became known as **rumat al-hadaq** — a phrase variously translated as "eye-smiters," "pupil-piercers," or "archers of the eyes." [E]

**The Epithet's Meaning:** The phrase suggests that Nubian archers specifically targeted the faces and eyes of their enemies. [P] This was not metaphor but tactical description. Against armored cavalry, body shots were often ineffective; a skilled archer would aim for the face, the hands, or other exposed areas. The systematic targeting of eyes was particularly devastating psychologically. A soldier might survive a wound to the limb or torso; an arrow through the eye meant death or permanent disfigurement.

**Arab Testimony:** The fact that Arab sources preserved this epithet is significant. [E] These were chroniclers writing in the tradition of conquest, celebrating Arab victories across three continents. That they recorded — and remembered for centuries — the devastating effectiveness of Nubian archery speaks to the profound impression it made. This was not a minor setback but a shocking encounter with a military force that could hurt them badly.

**The Scale of Casualties:** Specific casualty figures are not reliably preserved, but Arab sources indicate significant losses. [P] Some accounts mention that many Arabs returned blinded or disfigured by arrow wounds. The psychological impact exceeded the material damage: for the first time in their great expansion, Arab armies encountered an opponent who could consistently inflict unacceptable casualties.

### Qalidurut's Role

**The Question of Leadership:** Arabic sources name Qalidurut as a Nubian commander during the conflicts of 641-652 CE, but his precise role in the 641 engagement is unclear. [D] He may have commanded the forces that repelled this first invasion, or his prominence may date from the larger conflict of 651-652. Some scholars suggest he may have been a local commander in 641 who rose to overall command by the time of the second invasion.

**What We Can Infer:** Whether or not Qalidurut personally directed the 641 defense, he operated within the military system that produced it. [P] The Nubian victory demonstrated not just individual archery skill but military organization: the ability to concentrate forces, engage an enemy effectively, and maintain discipline under pressure. Someone — whether Qalidurut or others — had prepared Nubia to resist.

---

## The Second Arab Invasion (651-652 CE)

### Arab Preparations

A decade after the first setback, the Arabs returned in force. [E] This was no reconnaissance but a full-scale invasion intended to conquer Nubia as Egypt had been conquered.

**The Commander: Abdallah ibn Sa'd:** The expedition was led by Abdallah ibn Sa'd ibn Abi Sarh, the Arab governor of Egypt. [E] Abdallah was an experienced commander who had participated in the conquest of North Africa. He was also a controversial figure — a former Muslim who had apostatized, been condemned to death by Muhammad, then reconverted and been pardoned. His appointment to Egypt reflected Caliph Uthman's policy of placing relatives in key positions (Abdallah was Uthman's foster brother). He had both the authority and the motivation to pursue a major campaign.

**The Arab Army:** The invasion force was substantial, though precise numbers are uncertain. [P] Arabic sources suggest several thousand cavalry and infantry — a force comparable to those that had conquered major Byzantine cities. The army was composed of battle-hardened veterans of the Egyptian conquest and reinforcements from Arabia. They brought siege equipment, confident that they could take any Nubian fortification.

**Strategic Objectives:** The Arabs aimed to conquer Makuria, install a compliant ruler or administration, and open the Nile corridor for further expansion into Africa. [P] Control of Nubia would also secure Egypt's southern frontier and provide access to the gold, slaves, and ivory that flowed from the African interior.

### The Nubian Defense

**Qalidurut Takes Command:** By 651-652 CE, Qalidurut was clearly a major figure in Nubian military leadership. [P] Arabic sources name him as a key commander, possibly the overall leader of Nubian resistance. His exact title or position within the Makurian hierarchy is unknown — he may have been a royal relative, a military noble (eparch), or a professional soldier who rose through merit. What matters is that he exercised effective command.

**Strategic Situation:** Qalidurut faced a formidable challenge. [P] The Arab army was larger than the 641 expedition, better prepared, and determined to succeed. The Arabs controlled Egypt, giving them a secure base and supply line. They could replace losses; Nubia could not. In a war of attrition, time favored the invaders.

**Nubian Advantages:** Against these disadvantages, Qalidurut could deploy several strategic assets:

1. **Terrain:** The Nile valley in Nubia is narrow, hemmed by desert. An invading army must advance along the river, limiting the mobility that gave Arab cavalry its advantage elsewhere. [P]

2. **Distance:** Old Dongola lay hundreds of miles south of the Egyptian frontier. Every mile stretched Arab supply lines and exposed them to harassment. [P]

3. **Archery:** The Nubian military system, built around the bow, was ideally suited to defensive warfare in this terrain. Archers could engage from prepared positions, inflict casualties, and withdraw before Arab cavalry could close. [P]

4. **Fortifications:** Makuria had fortified positions along the Nile. Arab siege equipment, effective against Mediterranean stone walls, might prove less decisive against Nubian defensive works adapted to local conditions. [P]

5. **Unity:** Unlike Byzantine Egypt, where religious and ethnic divisions had facilitated Arab conquest, Makuria was a cohesive Christian kingdom with a population loyal to its rulers and hostile to foreign invasion. [P]

### The Campaign

**The Arab Advance:** Abdallah ibn Sa'd led his army south from Egypt, advancing along the Nile toward Makuria. [E] The Nubians did not attempt to stop the invasion at the frontier. This may reflect strategic calculation — allowing the Arabs to extend their supply lines before engaging — or the practical difficulty of defending such an extended border. [S]

**Fighting in the Approaches:** As the Arabs advanced, they encountered increasing Nubian resistance. [P] Nubian forces harassed the column, engaging with archery and withdrawing before the Arabs could bring their cavalry to bear. Each day's march cost casualties. The "eye-smiters" earned their reputation again — Arab soldiers blinded, maimed, or killed by arrows that struck with terrible precision.

**The Siege of Old Dongola:** The Arab army reached Old Dongola, the Makurian capital. [E] What followed was intense fighting — the Arabic sources describe it as a siege, though the exact nature of the operations is unclear. The Arabs brought up their siege equipment and attempted to take the city by force.

**The Cathedral Incident:** Arabic sources record a remarkable detail: Nubian arrows struck and damaged the mosque that accompanied the Arab army. [P] Some accounts mention that arrows hit the cathedral of Old Dongola, causing damage. This detail — whether it refers to the Arab camp mosque or an attack on the cathedral — indicates the intensity of urban or suburban combat. The fighting was not conducted at safe distance; arrows flew into the heart of both encampments.

**Nubian Archery in Urban Combat:** The fighting around Dongola demonstrated that Nubian archery was effective in siege warfare as well as field combat. [P] Archers firing from walls, buildings, or prepared positions could engage attackers with impunity, while Arab cavalry — their primary offensive arm — was neutralized in close terrain. The Arabs could not simply charge and overwhelm Nubian positions as they had overwhelmed Byzantine garrisons.

**Qalidurut's Command:** The defense of Dongola required coordinated leadership. [P] Qalidurut — whether commanding overall or leading a major formation — had to maintain discipline under extraordinary pressure. Medieval defensive warfare demanded precise timing: when to hold, when to counterattack, when to withdraw. Nubian forces under Qalidurut's direction achieved this coordination effectively enough to prevent Arab breakthrough.

**Arab Losses:** The Arab army suffered severely. [P] Precise casualty figures are not available, but the sources indicate that losses were substantial — enough to make continued operations problematic. The "eye-smiters" had done their work. Arab soldiers who had conquered Egypt found themselves unable to conquer Nubia.

### The Stalemate

**Why the Arabs Did Not Win:** After reaching Dongola and engaging in heavy fighting, the Arab invasion stalled. [E] Several factors contributed:

1. **Casualties:** Arab losses were too heavy to sustain. Replacement troops would have to march from Egypt — hundreds of miles through hostile territory. [P]

2. **Supply:** The army had outrun its supply lines. Feeding a large force in the narrow Nile valley, while hostile forces controlled the hinterland, was increasingly difficult. [P]

3. **Tactical Impasse:** Arab tactical superiority — mobile cavalry in open terrain — was neutralized by Nubian archery and the constricted geography. The Arabs could not bring their advantages to bear. [P]

4. **Morale:** The "eye-smiters" had inflicted a psychological toll. Soldiers who had conquered vast territories found themselves flinching from Nubian arrows. The certainty of victory, essential to morale, had been replaced by fear of the next attack. [S]

**Why the Nubians Did Not Win Outright:** Qalidurut's forces had inflicted heavy damage but could not destroy the Arab army entirely. [P] Nubian military strength was primarily defensive; they lacked the cavalry and numbers to pursue a retreating enemy and annihilate it. A stalemate suited Nubia — they wanted the Arabs gone, not destroyed — but it meant the conflict would end through negotiation rather than decisive battle.

## The Baqt Treaty (652 CE)

### The Negotiation

Faced with stalemate, both sides turned to diplomacy. The result was the Baqt — one of the most consequential treaties in medieval African and Middle Eastern history. [E]

**Who Negotiated:** The Nubian side was represented by Qalidurut or by the Makurian king (possibly named in some sources as Qalidurut himself, or with Qalidurut acting as the king's military representative). [D] The Arab side was represented by Abdallah ibn Sa'd or his deputies. The negotiations likely occurred in or near Dongola, with both armies still in the field.

**The Framework:** The Baqt was not a surrender document but a diplomatic agreement between independent powers. [E] Its very name — from Latin *pactum* via Greek, reflecting the diplomatic vocabulary of the late Roman/Byzantine world — indicates its character. This was a formal treaty of the kind the Romans had made with neighboring kingdoms, adapted to Islamic-Nubian circumstances.

**Qalidurut's Achievement:** Whoever represented Nubia at the negotiating table achieved something remarkable: they persuaded an undefeated Arab army to treat Nubia as an equal. [P] The Arabs had not been routed; they had not lost their army. They chose to negotiate because Nubian military resistance had made conquest prohibitively costly. Qalidurut — whether as negotiator or as the military commander whose forces created the leverage — was responsible for this outcome.

### The Terms

The Baqt established a comprehensive framework for Nubian-Egyptian relations. [E] Its key provisions:

**Non-Aggression:** Both sides agreed not to attack each other. [E] The Arab-Muslim state recognized Makurian sovereignty and agreed not to invade or attempt to conquer Nubian territory. Nubia agreed not to attack Egyptian territory.

**Trade Agreement:** The Baqt regulated commerce between the two polities. [E] Nubian and Egyptian merchants could trade in specified goods under agreed terms. This trade was mutually beneficial: Egypt received gold, ivory, and tropical products; Nubia received grain, textiles, horses, and Mediterranean manufactures.

**Annual Exchange:** The most distinctive (and controversial) provision required an annual exchange of goods:
- Nubia would send a specified number of enslaved people to Egypt annually — traditionally recorded as 360 or 365 individuals. [E]
- Egypt would send reciprocal goods to Nubia: wheat, wine, horses, and cloth. [E]

**The Slave Provision:** The requirement that Nubia provide enslaved people has generated extensive scholarly discussion. [D]
- Some interpret this as tribute imposed on a defeated power — evidence that Nubia was forced to accept subordinate status.
- Others note the reciprocal character: Egypt also provided goods to Nubia, making this an exchange rather than one-way tribute.
- The most likely interpretation is that this was a diplomatic compromise: the Arabs could not claim conquest, but they received something of value; Nubia maintained independence but paid a price.
- The enslaved people were likely captives from Nubia's own wars with neighboring peoples, not Makurian citizens — though this distinction offered cold comfort to those enslaved. [S]

**Neither Dhimmi nor Conquered:** Crucially, the Baqt did not place Nubia in any of the standard Islamic categories for non-Muslims. [E] Nubians were not *dhimmi* (protected non-Muslims under Islamic rule, paying the *jizya* poll tax). They were not a conquered population. They were an independent foreign power with whom the Islamic state maintained treaty relations. This status was unique in early Islamic expansion and reflected Nubian military success.

**Duration:** The Baqt was apparently intended as a permanent arrangement. [E] It would remain in force, with modifications and interruptions, for over six hundred years — until the Mamluk destruction of Makurian independence in the thirteenth century.

### Why the Baqt Matters

**Uniqueness in Islamic Expansion:** The Baqt was the only agreement of its kind in the early Islamic conquests. [E] Elsewhere, Arab armies either conquered or were defeated and withdrew. The middle path — indefinite coexistence between an Islamic state and an unconquered non-Muslim kingdom as diplomatic equals — emerged only in Nubia. This reflects the specific military situation Qalidurut helped create.

**Preservation of Nubian Civilization:** The Baqt preserved Christian Nubian civilization for over six centuries. [E] During this period:
- Nubian Christianity flourished, producing distinctive art, architecture, and literature
- The Nubian church maintained its connection to the Coptic patriarch in Alexandria
- Nubian kings ruled as sovereign Christian monarchs, not as Islamic vassals
- Nubian culture developed independently, uninterrupted by conquest

**A Diplomatic Model:** The Baqt demonstrated that Islamic expansion could be contained through military resistance and diplomatic skill. [P] While most of the world that faced Arab armies in the seventh century either fell to conquest or, like Byzantium, survived only through desperate struggle, Nubia achieved a stable accommodation. This was neither submission nor endless war but a sustainable arrangement that served both parties.

## Personality and Character

The sources reveal almost nothing about Qalidurut's personal characteristics. [S] What follows is inference from his actions and context.

### A Commander Who Understood His Strengths

Qalidurut's defense of Nubia was not flashy — there are no recorded heroic single combats or dramatic charges. [S] Instead, the evidence suggests a commander who understood exactly what his forces could and could not do:

**Defensive Orientation:** Rather than attempting to stop the Arabs at the frontier or challenge them in open battle, Nubian strategy allowed the invaders to extend themselves, then engaged them in terrain that neutralized Arab advantages. This suggests a commander who could resist the temptation to seek decisive battle and instead fight the war his army could win. [S]

**Archery as System:** The effectiveness of Nubian archery reflected not just individual skill but organizational competence. Archers must be supplied with arrows (an enormous logistical requirement), positioned correctly, and coordinated in their fire. Qalidurut commanded a system, not just a collection of skilled individuals. [P]

**Knowing When to Negotiate:** Equally important, Qalidurut (or the leadership he represented) recognized when military pressure had achieved its purpose. The Nubians did not continue fighting after the Arabs offered acceptable terms. This restraint — rare in commanders who have achieved military success — prevented the conflict from escalating into a war of annihilation that Nubia might eventually have lost. [S]

### A Christian Defender

Qalidurut defended a Christian kingdom against Muslim invasion at a moment when Christianity was in retreat almost everywhere. [P]

**Religious Context:** The conflict between Nubia and the Arabs was not merely political or military but carried profound religious significance. Qalidurut was defending not just territory but a faith, a civilization, and a way of life. While we cannot know his personal piety, he operated within a society where Christianity was central to identity and kingship was understood in religious terms. [S]

**The "New Constantine" Legacy:** Later Nubian kings would receive epithets like "The New Constantine," explicitly comparing them to the Roman emperor who championed Christianity. Qalidurut, though he predated this terminology, was the prototype: the Christian warrior who defended the faith against foreign conquest. [S]

### The Missing Voice

We do not have Qalidurut's own words. [E] No Nubian chronicle of the Arab invasions survives. We know him only through the testimony of his enemies — Arabic sources written by the very people he defeated. That these sources preserved his name and acknowledged his role speaks to the impression he made, but their perspective is necessarily limited and hostile.

What did Qalidurut himself think he was doing? How did he understand the conflict? What did he say to his soldiers before battle, to the king he served, to the Arab commanders across the negotiating table? These questions cannot be answered. The silence of the Nubian sources leaves Qalidurut as a figure of actions rather than words.

---

## Legacy and Historical Impact

### The Immediate Aftermath

**Nubian Independence Secured:** The Baqt treaty achieved its immediate purpose. [E] Arab armies did not return in conquest mode. Nubia entered a period of security and prosperity that would last for centuries.

**The Baqt in Practice:** Following the treaty, Nubian-Egyptian relations settled into a routine. [P] The annual exchange was conducted, trade flowed along the Nile, and occasional diplomatic missions maintained the relationship. There were tensions and interruptions, but the basic framework held.

**Makuria's Rise:** Freed from the threat of conquest, Makuria entered its golden age. [E] The kingdom expanded (possibly absorbing Nobatia and establishing hegemony over Alodia), built magnificent churches adorned with painted frescoes, and developed a sophisticated Christian culture. All of this was possible because Qalidurut's defense had preserved the kingdom's independence.

### The Long Perspective

**Six Hundred Years:** The Baqt framework, established in 652 CE, remained operative until the Mamluk invasions of the late thirteenth century — a span of over six hundred years. [E] During this entire period, Christian Nubia maintained its independence while surrounded by an expanding Islamic world. This is an extraordinary record of diplomatic success.

**What Qalidurut Made Possible:** Consider what survived because of the 652 treaty:
- The Cathedral of Faras and its magnificent frescoes (rediscovered in the 1960s)
- The churches and palaces of Old Dongola
- The Old Nubian literary tradition
- Six centuries of Christian civilization along the Middle Nile
- The unique Nubian artistic tradition, blending African and Mediterranean elements

All of this would have been lost had the Arabs conquered in 651-652 as they conquered everywhere else.

**Comparison with Elsewhere:** The contrast with neighboring regions is stark:
- **Egypt:** Conquered 639-642; gradual Islamization and Arabization over the following centuries
- **North Africa:** Conquered by 709; the formerly Christian populations eventually disappeared entirely
- **Persia:** Conquered by 651; Zoroastrian civilization ended (except for refugee communities)
- **Iberia:** Conquered 711-718; Christian Visigothic kingdom destroyed

Nubia alone, among these regions, preserved its independence and its Christian civilization. Qalidurut's defense was the foundation of this exception.

### Why Nubia Succeeded

**Military Factors:**
1. **The Archers:** Nubian archery was genuinely superior to anything the Arabs faced elsewhere. The "eye-smiters" earned their epithet through demonstrated effectiveness. [E]

2. **Terrain:** The narrow Nile valley in Nubia negated Arab cavalry advantages. Geography fought on Nubia's side. [P]

3. **Distance:** Nubia was far from the Arab heartland. Sustaining a long campaign required supply lines stretching hundreds of miles through hostile territory. [P]

4. **Cohesion:** Unlike Byzantine Egypt, where religious and ethnic divisions weakened resistance, Makuria was a unified Christian kingdom with a population loyal to its rulers. [P]

**Leadership Factors:**
1. **Qalidurut's Command:** Someone had to deploy Nubia's advantages effectively. Qalidurut provided competent, possibly brilliant, military leadership. [P]

2. **Diplomatic Skill:** Equally important, Nubian leadership knew when to fight and when to negotiate. The Baqt was not forced on Nubia by military defeat; it was accepted as a reasonable outcome of military stalemate. [P]

3. **Strategic Patience:** Nubia did not seek to conquer the Arab world or even to drive the Arabs from Egypt. The strategic objective was defensive: preserve Nubian independence. This limited aim was achievable; more ambitious goals might have provoked overwhelming retaliation. [S]

### The African Dimension

**African Military Achievement:** Qalidurut's defense was an African military achievement. [P] The armies he commanded were African. The military tradition he represented — Nubian archery — was indigenous to the Nile valley. The tactical and strategic decisions were made by Africans defending African land. In the dominant narrative of early Islamic expansion, the Arabs appear as unstoppable conquerors and everyone else as victims. Qalidurut's Nubia demonstrates that Africans could — and did — stop them.

**Against the "Passive Africa" Narrative:** Colonial-era historiography often portrayed Africans as passive recipients of external influences, lacking the agency to shape their own history. Qalidurut's career refutes this narrative decisively. Here was an African commander who faced the most powerful military force of his era and achieved something no European, Persian, or Byzantine commander managed in this period: indefinite preservation of his polity's independence.

## Scholarly Debates

| Question | Position A | Position B | Current Consensus |
|----------|------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Qalidurut's identity** | A Nubian general serving the Makurian king | Qalidurut may have been the king himself (some sources conflate military and royal titles) | Uncertain; probably a military commander rather than the king [D] |
| **His role in 641 vs 651-652** | Active in both invasions | Prominent only in the second invasion; 641 leader unknown | Insufficient evidence; his prominence is clearest in 651-652 [D] |
| **The Baqt's character** | A tribute treaty imposed on Nubia after military setback | A diplomatic agreement between equals, reflecting Nubian military success | Modern scholarship emphasizes the treaty's reciprocal character and Nubia's strength [P] |
| **Why the Arabs accepted the Baqt** | Military stalemate made conquest too costly | Other strategic priorities (continuing wars against Byzantium, internal politics) drew attention elsewhere | Probably both factors contributed [P] |
| **The slave provision** | Tribute indicating Nubian subordination | Part of reciprocal exchange; both sides provided goods | Reciprocal interpretation now dominant, though the provision remains troubling [D] |

### Key Uncertainties

**Personal Details:** We know almost nothing about Qalidurut personally:
- Birth date: Unknown
- Death date: Unknown
- Family: Unknown
- Title or exact position: Uncertain
- Physical appearance: Unknown
- Personal beliefs: Inferred from context only

**Nubian Sources:** No Nubian account of the Arab invasions survives. [E] We depend entirely on Arabic sources, which have their own biases and may have garbled or simplified Nubian names, titles, and military organization.

**The "Qalidurut" Name:** The name as preserved in Arabic sources may be a transliteration of a Nubian name, a title, or a combination of both. [D] Its meaning in Old Nubian (if it is Nubian) is unknown.

## For Fiction Writing

### Dramatic Potential

**EXCEPTIONAL.** Qalidurut's story contains the elements of epic narrative: a civilization under threat, a commander who rises to meet the challenge, a seemingly invincible enemy stopped in its tracks, and a diplomatic resolution that preserves everything worth preserving.

**The Last Wall Motif:** Qalidurut's Nubia was the wall at which the Arab conquests finally stopped. The drama lies in the asymmetry: the mightiest military force of the age, fresh from destroying empires, against a single African kingdom that should have fallen like all the others — but didn't.

**The Unknown Hero:** Qalidurut is both documented enough to be real and obscure enough to be imagined. A fiction writer has room to develop his personality, relationships, and inner life without contradicting the historical record, because the historical record is largely silent on these matters.

**David and Goliath (With a Twist):** The narrative echoes the biblical David — a smaller power defeating a great empire through skill and divine favor. For a Christian Nubian audience, this resonance would have been explicit. For modern readers, the appeal of the underdog is universal.

**The Problem of Victory:** Most "last stand" narratives end in heroic defeat. Qalidurut's story ends in victory — but the peculiar victory of a negotiated peace rather than annihilation of the enemy. This is historically accurate but narratively unusual, offering opportunities for exploring the complexities of successful defense rather than the simpler emotions of glorious death.

### Sensory World

**The Nile Valley Landscape:**
- The great river flowing north, the source of all life in this region
- Narrow strips of green cultivation along the banks, then desert immediately beyond
- Date palm groves, mud-brick villages, scattered acacia trees
- The cataracts where the river becomes unnavigable — rocky rapids that divide the Nile into distinct reaches
- Desert horizons in every direction, tan and ochre under the blazing sun
- The dry heat of the Sudanese climate — fierce in summer, more moderate in winter

**Old Dongola:**
- The capital rising from the east bank of the Nile
- Churches with their distinctive Nubian architecture: thick walls, flat roofs, cool dim interiors
- The royal palace (whose ruins have been excavated)
- Fortifications that would face the Arab assault
- Streets where Greek, Coptic, and Old Nubian might all be heard
- The cathedral, center of religious life, its walls painted with images of saints and kings

**The Military Landscape:**
- Nubian archers in their positions, bows ready, quivers full
- The distinctive Nubian bow — powerful enough to penetrate armor at distance
- Arrow shafts by the thousand, each a potential death
- The sound of bowstrings releasing, the whistle of arrows in flight, the impact of iron points on flesh and armor
- Defensive positions on walls, in buildings, behind improvised cover
- The Arab army: cavalry on desert horses, infantry with spears and swords, siege equipment hauled up the Nile

**Sound:**
- The Nile: the eternal background of flowing water
- Combat: bowstrings singing, arrows striking, horses screaming, men crying out in Arabic and Old Nubian
- Church bells calling the faithful to prayer
- Commands in Old Nubian, the language of the army
- Arabic shouted by the invaders — the language of the enemy

**Smell:**
- The river: mud and water and growing things
- Desert: dry, clean, the smell of emptiness
- Battle: blood, sweat, fear, the acrid smell of a large army encamped
- Incense in the churches
- Animal dung, cooking fires, the smells of daily life

### Speech and Voice

**Languages:**
- **Old Nubian:** The vernacular language of Makuria. Qalidurut would have spoken to his soldiers, his family, and his king in this tongue. [P]
- **Greek:** The language of literacy and church administration. Commands might have been written in Greek; diplomatic correspondence used Greek forms. [P]
- **Coptic:** The liturgical language connecting Nubia to the Coptic Church. [P]
- **Arabic:** The language of the enemy. Qalidurut or his interpreters would have needed Arabic for negotiation. Knowing your enemy's language was essential. [S]

**Military Commands:**
- Short, sharp orders in Old Nubian: where to stand, when to loose, when to fall back
- The rhythm of archery: knock, draw, aim, release
- Signals for coordinated volleys
- Commands passed down the line from officer to soldier

**The Negotiating Table:**
- Formal diplomatic language, probably conducted through interpreters
- The precise terms of the Baqt worked out in careful phrasing
- The moment of agreement: oaths sworn, perhaps in the names of different gods

### Key Relationships

**The Makurian King:**
- Qalidurut served a king (whose name is not securely preserved). Their relationship — loyal commander and sovereign, or more complex — is unknown but essential.
- Did the king take personal command in battle? Did he defer to Qalidurut's military expertise? Did they agree on strategy, or did Qalidurut have to persuade a reluctant monarch?

**Fellow Commanders:**
- Qalidurut did not defend Nubia alone. Other officers, nobles, and commanders fought alongside him. Their names are lost, but they existed.
- Rivalries, friendships, professional respect — the relationships among military leaders would have shaped the defense.

**The Archers:**
- The soldiers who actually stopped the Arab army. Qalidurut commanded them, but they did the killing and dying.
- Professional warriors trained from youth, skilled beyond anything the Arabs had encountered
- Men with families, fears, faith — not just the statistics of a military system

**The Nubian Church:**
- Bishops and priests who blessed the army, prayed for victory, and embodied the Christian civilization Qalidurut defended
- The metropolitan bishop of Dongola would have been a major figure
- Did church leaders urge resistance? Did they counsel peace? Did they bless the Baqt or object to its terms?

**Abdallah ibn Sa'd:**
- The Arab commander, Qalidurut's opponent across the battlefield and the negotiating table
- An experienced general, a controversial figure in Islamic history, a man who could not achieve what he came to achieve
- Did they meet personally? Did they respect each other as soldiers, or did religious and cultural differences make empathy impossible?

### Scene Opportunities

1. **The First Volley:** The moment when Nubian arrows first fall on Arab cavalry — the whistle, the impacts, the screaming horses, the beginning of the "eye-smiters" legend.

2. **Council of War:** Qalidurut and the Makurian king discussing strategy. Do they defend at the frontier or let the Arabs extend themselves? How do they use their archery advantage? What if the defense fails?

3. **The Siege of Dongola:** Combat in and around the capital. Archers on the walls, Arab siege equipment below, the cathedral within arrow range of the fighting.

4. **The Blinded Soldiers:** Arab survivors of Nubian archery — men who will never see again, who will carry Nubia's mark for life. The psychological impact on both sides.

5. **The Negotiation:** Qalidurut (or the king's representative) facing Abdallah ibn Sa'd across a table or carpet. Two civilizations working out terms of coexistence.

6. **The Oath:** The moment when the Baqt is sealed — perhaps with oaths to the Christian God and to Allah, two faiths recognizing each other's legitimacy.

7. **The Arab Withdrawal:** The invaders marching north, leaving Nubia unconquered. Qalidurut watching them go, knowing what has been achieved.

8. **The Victory Celebration:** Thanksgiving in the cathedral, the king honoring his commanders, the people celebrating survival.

9. **The Years After:** Qalidurut in peacetime — if he survived to see it. The treaty working as intended. A soldier's work completed.

10. **The Long View:** Perhaps a deathbed scene, an old warrior reflecting on what he saved and what it cost.

### Worldview and Values

**Christian Faith:**
- Qalidurut defended a Christian kingdom, and Christianity was central to Makurian identity
- The conflict with Muslim invaders was religious as well as political
- Divine providence protected Nubia — this would have been the theological interpretation of victory
- The cathedral, the saints, the prayers of the faithful: all part of the world Qalidurut inhabited

**Military Honor:**
- A soldier's values: courage, skill, loyalty to comrades and king
- The pride of the archers in their craft, honed over generations
- The discipline that made Nubian military effectiveness possible
- Honor in victory, meaning both military success and honorable conduct

**Defense of Homeland:**
- The Nile valley was home, the land of ancestors, the only world that mattered
- Foreign conquest meant not just political subjugation but destruction of a way of life
- Every arrow fired was defense of family, faith, and civilization

**The Limits of Victory:**
- Qalidurut achieved survival, not conquest
- The Arabs were not destroyed; they would remain Nubia's neighbors forever
- The Baqt was a compromise — Nubia gave up something (the annual exchange) to preserve everything else
- A warrior who understood that the purpose of war is peace, not endless conflict

**African Pride:**
- Whether Qalidurut thought in these terms is unknowable, but he defended African land against foreign invasion
- The military tradition he represented was indigenous, developed over centuries by Nile valley peoples
- His victory demonstrated that African armies could defeat the most powerful forces of the age

### Source Assessment

**What We Know:**
- The Arab invasions occurred (641, 651-652 CE) [E]
- The Nubians successfully resisted, earning the "eye-smiters" epithet [E]
- The Baqt treaty was negotiated (652 CE) [E]
- Qalidurut was a Nubian commander involved in the conflict [P]
- The treaty preserved Nubian independence for centuries [E]

**What We Don't Know:**
- Qalidurut's exact role (overall commander vs. one of several)
- His title, rank, and position in Makurian hierarchy
- His personal characteristics, family, early life, death
- The precise course of military operations
- The detailed negotiations leading to the Baqt
- Any Nubian-perspective account of the events

**The Fundamental Problem:**
No Nubian account survives. [E] We depend entirely on Arabic sources, written by the enemies of the Nubians, often centuries after the events. These sources had no particular interest in correctly recording Nubian names, titles, or perspectives. Qalidurut exists in the historical record, but the historical record offers only a glimpse of the man.

### Comparison with Other Defenders
- Qalidurut achieved what these commanders could not:
  - Byzantine commanders in Syria and Egypt (conquered 634-642)
  - Yazdegerd III of Persia (empire destroyed 651)
  - Roderic of Visigothic Spain (kingdom destroyed 711)
- Only comparable success: Byzantine defense of Constantinople (674-678, 717-718) — but Byzantium eventually lost vast territories anyway
