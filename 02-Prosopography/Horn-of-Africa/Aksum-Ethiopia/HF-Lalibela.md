## Overview

Lalibela stands as one of the most remarkable figures in African history — a king whose architectural vision produced what has been called the "eighth wonder of the world." The eleven rock-hewn churches carved directly from the volcanic tuff at the site that now bears his name represent one of humanity's greatest engineering and artistic achievements. These are not buildings constructed from stone blocks but monolithic structures excavated downward from the living rock, their roofs level with the surrounding terrain, their interiors hollowed out to create columns, arches, windows, and elaborate decorative programs — all carved from a single mass of stone. That such an achievement could be accomplished in medieval Ethiopia, with hand tools and the labor of devoted artisans, testifies to the sophistication of Zagwe-era Ethiopian civilization and the extraordinary ambition of its greatest king.

Yet Lalibela the man remains largely obscured behind Lalibela the saint. Our primary source for his life is the *Gadla Lalibela* (Acts of Lalibela), a hagiography composed perhaps a century or more after his death. Like all hagiographies, this text aims to edify rather than to document: it presents Lalibela as a divinely chosen figure whose life was marked by miraculous events from birth to death. Bees swarmed around the infant Lalibela without stinging him, recognized by his mother as a sign of future sovereignty. He survived a poisoning attempt by his jealous brother. He visited Jerusalem — or received a divine vision of the Holy City — and returned with the determination to build a "New Jerusalem" in Ethiopia where Christians could worship without the dangers of pilgrimage to the Muslim-controlled original. Angels, tradition holds, labored alongside human workers by night to complete the churches. The historical kernel within these traditions is difficult to isolate, but the churches themselves — massive, beautiful, and undeniably real — testify that a ruler of exceptional vision and organizational capacity did commission them.

The Zagwe dynasty to which Lalibela belonged ruled Ethiopia from approximately 1137 to 1270, a period later Solomonic historians dismissed as an illegitimate interregnum. The Zagwe were Agaw-speaking peoples from the Lasta region, distinct from the Semitic-speaking Aksumite elite who preceded them and the Amhara-Tigrinya Solomonic dynasty that followed. Yet Zagwe Ethiopia was thoroughly Christian, deeply engaged with the traditions of Ethiopian Orthodoxy, and productive of cultural achievements — above all the rock-hewn churches — that rival anything in Ethiopian history. Lalibela's churches remain active places of worship today, eight centuries after their construction, filled with the chanting of priests and the prayers of pilgrims. His feast day (June 12 in the Ethiopian calendar) draws thousands of faithful to the site. In Ethiopian Orthodox tradition, he is venerated as one of the great saints — a king who used his power not for conquest but for the glory of God.

## Early Life and Legend

### Birth and the Omen of the Bees

The hagiographic tradition presents Lalibela's birth as marked by divine signs. [T] According to the *Gadla Lalibela*, when the infant was born in the village of Roha (later renamed Lalibela in his honor), a dense swarm of bees surrounded him without causing harm. His mother, seeing this, exclaimed "Lalibela!" — a name interpreted to mean "the bees recognize his sovereignty" or "the bees gave him homage." This omen was understood as a prophecy that the child would become king. [T]

The date of Lalibela's birth is unknown. If we accept a reign beginning around 1181 and assume he came to power as a mature adult, his birth might be placed in the mid-twelfth century — perhaps around 1140-1160 CE — but this is entirely speculative. [S]

### Family and Lineage

Lalibela was born into the Zagwe royal family, the ruling dynasty of Christian Ethiopia since approximately 1137. [P] The Zagwe were Agaw (Cushitic-speaking) peoples from the Lasta region of the central Ethiopian highlands. Unlike the earlier Aksumite dynasty and the later Solomonic house, both of which claimed Semitic ancestry and used Ge'ez as their court language, the Zagwe represented a different ethnic and linguistic tradition — though they fully embraced Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity and the Ge'ez ecclesiastical culture. [E]

The hagiography names Lalibela's father as Jan Seyum and his mother as Kirwarna (or Mesob Werq). [T] He had at least one brother, Kedus Harbe (Harbay), who preceded him on the throne. The relationship between the brothers was fraught: the hagiography presents Harbe as a jealous rival who attempted to kill Lalibela, first by poison and later by exile. [T]

The Zagwe genealogies are confused and inconsistent across sources. Some traditions make Lalibela the younger brother of Harbe; others suggest more complex relationships. The sequence of Zagwe kings itself is debated, with different sources providing different lists. What seems clear is that Lalibela came from within the ruling family and that his path to the throne involved conflict with his predecessor. [D]

### Poisoning, Exile, and Divine Vision

The *Gadla Lalibela* presents a dramatic narrative of the young prince's persecution and divine protection. [T] According to this account:

**The Poisoning:** King Harbe, fearing the prophecy implied by the bee omen, attempted to eliminate his brother by poison. Lalibela consumed the poison but did not die. Instead, he fell into a death-like sleep or trance lasting three days — a clear parallel to Christ's three days in the tomb. During this period, Lalibela's soul was taken up to heaven, where he was shown the heavenly Jerusalem and instructed in the plan for the churches he would build. [T]

**The Vision:** In the celestial realm, God (or angels) showed Lalibela the design for the eleven churches, explaining their arrangement, their dedication, and their symbolic meaning as a "New Jerusalem" that would allow Ethiopian Christians to make pilgrimage without the dangers of travel to the actual Holy Land. Lalibela was commanded to return to earth and construct this sacred complex. [T]

**The Exile:** Upon awakening from his visionary trance, Lalibela remained under his brother's suspicion. The hagiography describes a period of exile, possibly in Jerusalem itself (see below), before Lalibela eventually returned to Ethiopia, overthrew or succeeded his brother, and assumed the throne. [T]

### The Jerusalem Question

A central debate in Lalibela studies concerns whether the king actually traveled to Jerusalem. [D]

**The pilgrimage tradition:** Ethiopian tradition holds that Lalibela visited Jerusalem during his exile, spending years in the Holy Land absorbing its sacred geography, architecture, and atmosphere. This journey would have occurred before 1187, when Saladin's conquest of Jerusalem made Christian pilgrimage significantly more difficult (though not impossible). When Lalibela returned to Ethiopia and assumed the throne, he replicated what he had seen — creating an Ethiopian Jerusalem where his subjects could worship in safety. [T]

**The vision alternative:** Other interpretations suggest Lalibela never traveled to Jerusalem but received divine knowledge of the Holy City through his three-day vision. In this reading, his architectural program was divinely revealed rather than empirically observed. This interpretation emphasizes the miraculous nature of the achievement and does not require a historical journey. [T]

**Scholarly assessment:** Most modern scholars are skeptical of the literal pilgrimage narrative while acknowledging that Ethiopian connections to Jerusalem were real and longstanding. Ethiopian Christians had maintained a presence in Jerusalem since at least the fourth century; the Ethiopian chapel at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre testifies to this enduring relationship. Knowledge of Jerusalem's geography and architecture could have reached Lalibela through pilgrims, clerical visitors, or artistic/literary traditions without the king himself traveling there. The churches' layout does loosely correspond to Jerusalem's sacred geography (with a stream named "Jordan," churches representing Golgotha, the tomb of Adam, etc.), but this correspondence may be a later interpretation rather than original intent. [D]

## The Zagwe Dynasty Context

### Origins and Legitimacy

The Zagwe dynasty emerged around 1137, apparently seizing power from the declining remnants of the Aksumite royal house. [P] The circumstances of this transition are poorly documented. Later Solomonic sources present the Zagwe as usurpers who interrupted the legitimate Solomonic line — but these sources were produced by the very dynasty that overthrew the Zagwe and had obvious motivations to delegitimize their predecessors. [E]

The Zagwe represented the Agaw peoples of the Lasta region, Cushitic-speakers who had long inhabited the central Ethiopian highlands. While the Aksumite elite spoke Semitic languages (Ge'ez, and later ancestral Tigrinya and Amharic), the Agaw had their own linguistic and cultural traditions. This ethnic distinction became central to later Solomonic propaganda, which portrayed the Zagwe as outsiders who lacked the divine mandate of the Solomonic line. [P]

Yet the Zagwe were thoroughly Christian, fully integrated into the institutional church, and productive of major ecclesiastical architecture. They did not represent a pagan or foreign intrusion but rather a shift in which highland Ethiopian community held political power within the Christian Ethiopian state. The church — whose hierarchy was appointed from Egypt and whose traditions were continuous from Aksumite times — remained a unifying institution across the dynastic transition. [E]

### Zagwe Achievements

The Zagwe period (c. 1137-1270) is poorly documented compared to the later Solomonic era, but the surviving evidence indicates cultural and architectural vitality: [P]

**Ecclesiastical Architecture:** Beyond Lalibela's famous churches, the Zagwe period produced significant rock-hewn and built churches across the Lasta region and beyond. The church of Yemrehanna Krestos, constructed inside a cave with elaborate stone-and-wood construction in the Aksumite tradition, dates to the Zagwe period and may slightly predate Lalibela's reign. This suggests that Lalibela's rock-hewn churches represented the culmination of a regional architectural tradition, not an isolated inspiration. [P]

**Monastic Culture:** Ethiopian monasticism, rooted in the traditions of the "Nine Saints" (fifth-sixth century missionaries), continued to flourish under Zagwe patronage. Monastic communities preserved manuscripts, trained clergy, and served as centers of learning and spiritual authority. [P]

**Trade and Diplomacy:** The Zagwe period saw continued Ethiopian engagement with the wider Christian and Islamic worlds. Trade routes connected the highlands to the Red Sea coast and beyond. Relations with the Coptic patriarchate in Egypt continued, with Ethiopian clerics traveling to Cairo to receive the appointment of each *Abuna* (metropolitan bishop). [P]

### The Zagwe Kings

The sequence of Zagwe kings is uncertain, with different sources providing different lists. [D] A commonly cited sequence includes:

1. Mara Tekle Haymanot — founder (?)
2. Jan Seyum — possibly Lalibela's father
3. Germa Seyum
4. Yemrehanna Krestos — builder of the cave church bearing his name
5. Kedus Harbe (Harbay) — Lalibela's brother and predecessor
6. **Lalibela** (Gebre Mesqel) — r. c. 1181-1221
7. Na'akueto La'ab — Lalibela's successor
8. Yetbarek — last Zagwe king (?)

The total number of Zagwe kings, their exact sequence, and the length of the dynasty's rule are all debated. Some traditions give the Zagwe 133 years (c. 1137-1270); others give longer or shorter periods. The scholarly consensus accepts a Zagwe period from roughly the early-to-mid twelfth century to 1270, but the internal chronology remains imprecise. [D]

## The Rock-Hewn Churches

### Overview: An Unparalleled Achievement

The rock-hewn churches of Lalibela constitute one of the most extraordinary architectural achievements in human history. [E] Eleven churches were carved directly from the volcanic tuff (a relatively soft, workable stone) of the Lasta highlands, excavated from the top downward so that each church is a monolithic mass of stone — the roof level with the surrounding terrain, the building emerging from a trench hewn around its perimeter, the interior hollowed out to create columns, arches, aisles, and decorative elements, all from a single piece of rock.

This is not construction in the ordinary sense but rather sculpture on an architectural scale. Workers carved away the negative space around each church, leaving the church itself as the positive remainder. The engineering challenges were immense: workers had to plan three-dimensionally, remove stone systematically without destabilizing the structure, create drainage systems to prevent water accumulation in the trenches, and execute decorative programs in reverse (carving what would normally be added). The fact that these churches survive eight centuries later, still in use, still structurally sound, testifies to the sophistication of the planning and execution. [E]

### The Eleven Churches

The churches are traditionally grouped into three clusters, plus one stand-alone church:

#### Northern Group (First Group)

1. **Biete Medhane Alem** (House of the Savior of the World) [E]
   - The largest monolithic rock-hewn church in the world
   - Approximately 33.5 meters long, 23.5 meters wide, 11.5 meters high
   - Modeled on the Church of St. Mary of Zion at Aksum (since destroyed)
   - 72 pillars, including exterior columns that form a colonnade
   - Three aisles; said to house a portion of the True Cross
   - Represents the earthly residence of God

2. **Biete Maryam** (House of Mary) [E]
   - Connected to Biete Medhane Alem by a rock-hewn passage
   - Rich interior decoration: carved crosses, geometric patterns, possibly the oldest surviving Ethiopian paintings
   - Contains the "Pillar of Light" — a wrapped column said to be inscribed with secrets of the world's creation
   - The personal church of King Lalibela according to tradition

3. **Biete Golgotha** (House of Golgotha) [E]
   - Contains the alleged tomb of King Lalibela
   - Connected to the chapel of Selassie (Holy Trinity)
   - Only men permitted to enter
   - Life-size relief carvings of saints on walls

4. **Biete Mikael** (House of Michael) [E]
   - Connected to Biete Golgotha; sometimes considered part of the same complex
   - Probably originally the royal chapel

5. **Biete Denagel** (House of Virgins) [E]
   - Small, possibly intended for female worshippers
   - Connected to the northern group by passages

#### Southern Group (Second Group)

6. **Biete Gabriel-Rufael** (House of Gabriel and Raphael) [E]
   - Possibly originally a royal palace later converted to ecclesiastical use
   - Approached by a rock-hewn walkway over a deep trench
   - Connected to Biete Mercurios by a tunnel

7. **Biete Mercurios** (House of Mercury/Mercurius) [E]
   - May originally have been a prison or court building
   - Features striking murals
   - Named for the martyr Saint Mercurius

8. **Biete Amanuel** (House of Emmanuel) [E]
   - Considered the finest example of Aksumite architectural style among the churches
   - Horizontal bands of projecting stonework mimic wood-and-stone construction
   - Possibly the royal chapel of the Zagwe dynasty

9. **Biete Abba Libanos** (House of Abbot Libanos) [E]
   - Only the roof carved free from the surrounding rock; floor and walls remain attached
   - Tradition credits its construction to Lalibela's wife, Queen Meskel Kebra
   - Named for Abuna Libanos, one of the "Nine Saints"

#### Western Group (Third Group)

10. **Biete Giyorgis** (House of St. George) [E]
    - The most famous and visually striking of the churches
    - Carved in the shape of a Greek cross, viewed from above
    - 12 meters x 12 meters x 12 meters — a perfect cube in cross-shaped plan
    - Stands alone, separated from the other groups
    - According to tradition, built last after St. George complained to Lalibela that he had no church dedicated to him
    - The most photographed church, often serving as the symbol of Lalibela

#### Connected Complex

11. **Biete Lehem** (House of Bethlehem) [E]
    - Small chapel, possibly a bakery for communion bread
    - Connected to the northern group

### Construction Methods

How were the churches actually built? The hagiographic answer — angelic assistance completing by night what humans began by day — reflects the tradition's awe at the achievement. [T] Modern analysis suggests a more earthly process:

**Tools:** Iron chisels, picks, and levers were the primary tools. The volcanic tuff (a compressed volcanic ash) is relatively soft when freshly exposed, hardening over time — a fortunate geological property that made carving feasible. [P]

**Workforce:** The churches required an enormous labor force sustained over years or decades. Estimates of construction time range from 24 years to over a century, depending on workforce assumptions. A large, organized workforce capable of sustained effort implies sophisticated state capacity, economic surplus to support non-agricultural labor, and centralized direction. [S]

**Engineering:** The builders demonstrated advanced understanding of:
- Structural loads and how to carve supporting columns
- Drainage — channels and cisterns divert rainwater away from the churches
- Light and ventilation — windows and internal passages manage both
- Acoustics — the churches have excellent acoustic properties for chanting
- Architectural proportions — the churches are aesthetically harmonious [P]

**Sequence:** Scholars debate whether all churches were built simultaneously, sequentially, or in overlapping phases. Some argue that differences in style and technique indicate multiple construction campaigns, possibly spanning multiple reigns. [D]

### Symbolic Geography: The "New Jerusalem"

Ethiopian tradition holds that Lalibela designed the complex as a symbolic replica of the Holy Land. [T] The correspondence includes:

**The Jordan River:** A stream running through the site is named Yordanos (Jordan), dividing the churches into symbolic Jerusalem (on one side) and symbolic Bethlehem (on the other). [E]

**Mount Golgotha:** Biete Golgotha represents the site of Christ's crucifixion. [T]

**The Tomb of Adam:** A chapel represents the traditional location of Adam's burial beneath Golgotha. [T]

**Mount Tabor, Sinai, etc.:** Various hills and features in the landscape are identified with biblical sites. [T]

The interpretation of Lalibela as a "New Jerusalem" is widely accepted, though some scholars argue that this symbolic layer may have been added after original construction, as the tradition developed. The correspondence between Lalibela and Jerusalem is real but imperfect — more evocative than precise. [D]

### The Churches Today

The rock-hewn churches of Lalibela remain active houses of worship, not museums. [E] Priests celebrate the Ethiopian Orthodox liturgy daily. Pilgrims arrive throughout the year, with especially large gatherings at major feast days, including Ethiopian Christmas (Genna, January 7), Timkat (Epiphany), and the feast of Saint Lalibela (June 12 Ethiopian calendar).

The site was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1978. Conservation efforts face challenges: the volcanic tuff continues to erode, water infiltration threatens the structures, and the shelters erected by UNESCO to protect some churches are themselves aesthetically controversial. The balance between preservation and continued use as living sacred spaces remains a point of negotiation between Ethiopian authorities, the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, and international heritage organizations. [E]

## Reign and Religious Policy

### Lalibela as Ruler

The hagiography presents Lalibela as a pious king whose primary concern was the glory of God rather than worldly conquest. [T] This may reflect hagiographic convention (saints are not supposed to be interested in worldly power) rather than historical reality. The construction of the churches itself demonstrates significant state capacity — a king who could command the resources and labor for such a project was not politically powerless.

**Administration:** Nothing specific is known about Lalibela's administrative practices. The Zagwe state presumably functioned through regional governors, tribute collection, and royal patronage networks similar to other Ethiopian polities, but the sources do not provide details. [S]

**Military Affairs:** The hagiography does not emphasize military campaigns, again probably reflecting genre expectations. The Zagwe state faced potential threats from Muslim sultanates to the east and south, pagan or semi-Christianized peoples to the west and south, and the ever-present possibility of provincial rebellion. A ruler who held the throne for forty years (if the traditional reign dates are accepted) must have managed these challenges somehow. [S]

**Succession:** The hagiography presents Lalibela's succession to his brother Harbe as divinely ordained rather than violently contested. The reality may have been more complex. Similarly, his relationship with his successor, Na'akueto La'ab, is presented as harmonious — the nephew inheriting peacefully from the childless uncle. [T]

### Religious Policy and Patronage

Lalibela's religious policy, insofar as we can reconstruct it, centered on the massive investment in ecclesiastical architecture:

**The Churches as Policy:** The construction of eleven rock-hewn churches required enormous resources — food to feed workers, tools, organization, supervision. This investment represented a choice about how to deploy royal surplus. Other rulers might have built armies or palaces; Lalibela built churches. Whether this reflects personal piety, political calculation (legitimating his rule through religious patronage), or both, the churches were clearly the defining project of his reign. [P]

**Monastic Relations:** Ethiopian kings typically maintained complex relationships with monastic communities, which wielded spiritual authority and could influence public opinion. The hagiography presents Lalibela as on excellent terms with the monastic establishment. [T]

**The Coptic Patriarch:** Like all Ethiopian rulers, Lalibela depended on the Coptic patriarch in Egypt to appoint the *Abuna*, the head of the Ethiopian church. This relationship made Ethiopia's church technically subordinate to the Coptic hierarchy — a periodic source of tension but also a connection to the wider Christian world. [E]

---

## The "New Jerusalem" Vision

### Context: Pilgrimage and the Fall of Jerusalem

Ethiopian Christians had long maintained connections to the Holy Land. The Ethiopian presence at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre dates to at least the fourth century. Ethiopian pilgrims made the dangerous journey to Jerusalem, passing through Egypt (under Muslim rule since 642) and Palestine. The Fatimid and later Ayyubid rulers of Egypt and the Holy Land generally tolerated Christian pilgrimage, though conditions varied. [E]

In 1187, Saladin reconquered Jerusalem from the Crusaders. [E] While Saladin permitted Christian worship and pilgrimage to continue, the city was now firmly under Muslim control, and the Crusader presence that had facilitated European pilgrimage was diminished. For Ethiopian Christians, whose route to Jerusalem passed through Muslim-controlled territory throughout, the change may have been less dramatic than for Latin Christians — but the event had symbolic power nonetheless.

### Lalibela's Response

Ethiopian tradition connects the churches of Lalibela directly to the fall of Jerusalem. [T] According to this tradition:

- Lalibela learned (through vision, pilgrimage, or report) of the difficulty Ethiopian Christians faced reaching the actual Jerusalem
- He determined to create a "New Jerusalem" in Ethiopia where his subjects could experience the Holy Land without leaving their homeland
- The churches were designed to replicate Jerusalem's sacred geography, allowing pilgrims to visit "Golgotha," cross the "Jordan," and venerate holy sites in safety
- The project was thus an act of pastoral care — a king providing his subjects with spiritual resources

This interpretation is theologically and narratively satisfying. Whether it reflects Lalibela's actual motivation is impossible to verify. [D]

### Alternative Interpretations

Some scholars question the Jerusalem connection:

**Pre-existing tradition:** Rock-hewn churches existed in Ethiopia before Lalibela, including earlier Zagwe-period examples. Lalibela may have been continuing an existing tradition rather than innovating in response to Jerusalem's fall. [P]

**Later symbolization:** The identification of Lalibela's features with Jerusalem's geography may have developed after construction, as the tradition grew. The correspondence is real but may reflect interpretation rather than original intent. [D]

**Royal legitimation:** The churches may have served primarily to legitimate Zagwe rule by demonstrating their piety and capacity, with the "New Jerusalem" symbolism a later addition. [S]

## Death and Sainthood

### Death and Burial

According to tradition, Lalibela died peacefully around 1221, having completed his life's work. [T] He was buried at Biete Golgotha, within the church complex he had created. The tomb remains a site of veneration today. [E]

The transition to his successor, Na'akueto La'ab (sometimes described as his nephew), appears to have been peaceful. Na'akueto La'ab is himself venerated as a saint in Ethiopian tradition; the hagiography presents a harmonious succession from one holy king to another. [T]

### Canonization and Veneration

Lalibela is venerated as a saint in the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. [E] His feast day is celebrated on June 12 in the Ethiopian calendar (Sene 12). He is commemorated as a righteous king whose works glorified God and served the faithful.

The cult of Saint Lalibela centers on the churches themselves. Pilgrims come to venerate the saint at his tomb in Biete Golgotha, to worship in the churches he built, and to experience the "New Jerusalem" he created. The saint and the site are inseparable in Ethiopian religious consciousness. [E]

### Legacy in Ethiopian Memory

In Ethiopian historical memory, Lalibela represents the Zagwe dynasty's greatest achievement and, paradoxically, a point of continuity with the Solomonic tradition that displaced the Zagwe. [P] The later Solomonic historians who dismissed the Zagwe as usurpers could not dismiss Lalibela's churches; they had to accommodate the sacred site within their own historical framework. The solution was to honor Lalibela as a saint while maintaining that the Zagwe dynasty as a whole lacked legitimacy — a somewhat awkward position that reflects the churches' undeniable significance.

## Scholarly Debates

### Dating the Reign

| Question | Position A | Position B | Current Status |
|----------|------------|------------|----------------|
| **Reign dates** | c. 1181-1221 (traditional dates derived from hagiography) | Reign may have been shorter, longer, or differently positioned within the 12th-13th centuries | Traditional dates widely cited but not independently verifiable [D] |
| **Start of reign** | Lalibela succeeded his brother Harbe peacefully after Harbe's natural death | Lalibela may have deposed or killed his brother | Hagiography presents peaceful succession; reality may differ [D] |
| **Reign length** | Approximately 40 years | Hagiographic conventions favor round numbers; actual length unknown | 40 years is conventional; some scholars suggest shorter reign [D] |

### Construction Timeline

| Question | Position A | Position B | Current Status |
|----------|------------|------------|----------------|
| **Single-reign construction** | All 11 churches built during Lalibela's reign | Churches built over multiple reigns, possibly beginning before Lalibela and continuing after | Most scholars now accept multi-phase construction [D] |
| **Construction period** | 23-24 years (tradition) | Possibly decades longer, even up to a century | Traditional timeline likely too compressed [D] |
| **Angelic assistance** | Divine intervention completed the work | Entirely human workforce, possibly organized in shifts | Hagiographic convention; no literal angelic assistance [E] |

### Architectural Sequence

| Question | Position A | Position B | Current Status |
|----------|------------|------------|----------------|
| **Which church first?** | Biete Medhane Alem (the largest) built first | Different scholars propose different sequences based on stylistic analysis | No consensus; sequence uncertain [D] |
| **Biete Giyorgis last?** | Built last, after St. George complained (tradition) | May have been planned from the beginning | Traditional account explains its isolation; architectural evidence ambiguous [D] |
| **Unified plan** | All churches designed as a single coordinated program | Churches added incrementally as resources permitted | Some coordination evident; full unity debated [D] |

### The Jerusalem Connection

| Question | Position A | Position B | Current Status |
|----------|------------|------------|----------------|
| **Did Lalibela visit Jerusalem?** | Yes, during exile; witnessed sacred geography firsthand | No literal pilgrimage; knowledge came through vision, tradition, or travelers' reports | No verifiable evidence of pilgrimage [D] |
| **Saladin's conquest as catalyst?** | The 1187 conquest of Jerusalem directly motivated the "New Jerusalem" project | Churches may have been motivated by other factors; Jerusalem connection could be later interpretation | Connection plausible but unverifiable [D] |
| **Original or later symbolization?** | Churches designed from the start as symbolic Jerusalem | Jerusalem symbolism developed after construction through accumulated tradition | Probably some original intent, elaborated by later tradition [P] |

### The Zagwe Legacy Problem

The scholarly assessment of the Zagwe dynasty has shifted over time:

**Earlier view:** Following Solomonic-era sources, some scholars treated the Zagwe as an aberrant interregnum between the "legitimate" Aksumite and Solomonic dynasties. [T]

**Current view:** Modern scholarship recognizes the Zagwe as a legitimate Ethiopian dynasty whose achievements — above all the rock-hewn churches — represent a high point of Ethiopian civilization. The "usurper" characterization is recognized as Solomonic propaganda. [P]

## For Fiction Writing

### Dramatic Potential

**HIGH.** Lalibela's story offers extraordinary material for historical fiction:

**The Visionary King:** A ruler who channels all the resources of his kingdom into a single overwhelming project of sacred architecture. What drives such a man? Pure faith? Political calculation? Personal obsession? The ambiguity is dramatically rich.

**The Impossible Achievement:** The churches themselves are so remarkable that they inspired legends of angelic assistance. A fiction exploring how human beings — with human limitations, conflicts, and ambitions — actually built them could be compelling.

**Faith and Power:** Lalibela is simultaneously a saint and a king. How do spiritual aspiration and political necessity coexist in one person? The hagiography smooths over tensions that fiction could explore.

**The Exile:** The period of Lalibela's exile (before his accession) is a blank that fiction could fill. Adventures in Jerusalem? Spiritual struggles in the wilderness? Plotting return and revenge?

**The Succession Crisis:** The hagiography presents a peaceful transition from Harbe to Lalibela, but the hint of jealousy and attempted murder suggests darker possibilities. A story of fraternal rivalry — Ethiopian Cain and Abel — could be powerful.

### Sensory World

**The Highlands of Lasta:**
- Altitude: 2,500-3,000 meters above sea level; thin, crisp air; brilliant sunlight
- Landscape: Dramatic escarpments, deep valleys, rocky outcrops; terraced hillsides for agriculture
- Vegetation: Eucalyptus (introduced later — not appropriate for Lalibela's time), juniper, wild olive; grasslands browning in dry season
- Climate: Cool temperatures year-round; distinct rainy season (June-September) and dry season
- Sky: Intense blue by day; spectacular stars by night at high altitude [P]

**The Construction Site:**
- Sound: Clink of iron tools on stone; chanting of work songs; priests singing liturgy in a completed church while workers carve an adjacent one
- Sight: Dust clouds rising from excavation; torchlight in tunnels; workers in white cotton garments, red with stone dust
- Smell: Stone dust; sweat; incense from the churches; wood smoke from cooking fires
- Touch: The volcanic tuff — coarse when freshly cut, smoothing over time; calloused hands gripping tool handles
- Taste: Injera and spiced stews at midday break; the rough local beer (*tella*) [S]

**Inside the Churches:**
- Darkness and light: Narrow windows create dramatic shafts of sunlight; torchlight flickering on carved columns
- Sound: Extraordinary acoustics — a single voice fills the space; the vibration of drums; the rattle of sistra (prayer rattles)
- Smell: Beeswax candles; ancient incense embedded in porous stone; the dry, clean smell of the rock itself
- The carpets and hangings: Brightly colored liturgical textiles against gray stone
- The sense of enclosure: These are not buildings sitting on the earth but caves carved into it; the weight of rock on all sides [E]

### Speech and Voice

**Languages:**
- Ge'ez: The liturgical and literary language; used in religious contexts and formal documents
- Agaw languages: The Zagwe were Agaw-speakers; Lalibela may have spoken an Agaw language natively
- Proto-Amharic: Emerging as a vernacular in this period
- A multilingual court where different languages served different functions [P]

**Modes of Address:**
- The king: "Negus" (King), "Jan Hoy" (Your Majesty), elaborate honorifics
- Religious figures: "Abuna" (Our Father) for the metropolitan; "Abba" for priests and monks
- Elaborate court protocols; indirect speech to superiors; formulaic blessings and greetings [P]

**Rhetorical Style:**
- Biblical allusion permeating all formal speech
- Proverbs and aphorisms from Ethiopian wisdom tradition
- Formal speech as performance; eloquence valued and expected
- The call-and-response patterns of Ethiopian liturgy carrying into secular speech [P]

### Key Relationships

**Harbe (Kedus Harbe) — Brother and Predecessor:**
The hagiography presents Harbe as a jealous persecutor who tried to kill Lalibela. The reality may have been more complex — perhaps legitimate political rivalry between branches of the royal family, later reframed as hagiographic drama.

**Meskel Kebra — Wife:**
Tradition credits Lalibela's wife (or one of his wives?) with the construction of Biete Abba Libanos. She is a minor figure in the hagiography but offers fictional possibilities: the queen as partner in the building project, perhaps contributing her own vision.

**Na'akueto La'ab — Successor:**
Described as Lalibela's nephew, he succeeded to the throne and is himself venerated as a saint. A relationship of mutual respect or one of tension?

**The *Abuna* — Metropolitan Bishop:**
The head of the Ethiopian church, appointed by the Coptic patriarch in Egypt, was the highest religious authority. His relationship with the king was crucial: a cooperative *Abuna* could legitimate royal projects; a hostile one could delegitimate them.

**The Master Builder(s):**
The hagiography credits angels, but human architects and craftsmen directed the actual construction. Who were they? The anonymous masters who solved the engineering problems and directed the workforce are invisible in the sources but essential to the achievement.

**Workers and Laborers:**
Thousands of workers, over years or decades, carved the churches. Some may have been conscripted; others may have volunteered as an act of religious devotion. Their experience of the project — pride, exhaustion, faith, resentment — is unrecorded but imaginable.

### Scene Opportunities

1. **The Vision:** Lalibela lying as if dead for three days while his soul journeys to heaven. The court in chaos — is the prince dead? The revelatory moment when he awakens and describes what he has seen.

2. **The First Cut:** The moment when workers begin excavating the first church. The king watches; the master builder directs; the iron tools bite into stone for the first time.

3. **Night Shifts:** If workers labored in shifts (the "angels by night" tradition may reflect this), a scene of exhausted workers stumbling home as fresh crews arrive by torchlight.

4. **The Dispute:** A conflict between the king and a skeptical advisor (or churchman) who questions whether such resources should be devoted to building. How does Lalibela convince or overrule?

5. **The Pilgrims Arrive:** The first pilgrims experiencing the completed churches. Their awe, their prayers, their tears. The king watching from a distance.

6. **Harbe's Jealousy:** A scene of confrontation between the brothers. The poisoning attempt? The decision to exile? The moment of fraternal treachery.

7. **In Jerusalem:** If we accept the pilgrimage tradition, scenes of Lalibela experiencing the actual Holy Land — the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, Golgotha, the Mount of Olives — and beginning to conceive his Ethiopian counterpart.

8. **Water Problem:** A crisis when rainwater threatens to flood a half-carved church. Engineers and workers scrambling to create drainage. The king praying while his builders improvise.

9. **Dedication:** The liturgical consecration of a completed church. Incense, chanting, the metropolitan bishop officiating, the king prostrate before the altar.

10. **Death and Burial:** Lalibela's final days. His placement in the tomb he had prepared within Biete Golgotha. The succession to Na'akueto La'ab.

### Worldview and Values

**What Mattered to Lalibela (as the tradition presents him):**

- **Faith:** Genuine, deep Christian devotion. The hagiography presents a man whose entire life was oriented toward God. Whether the historical Lalibela was as consistently pious as his hagiography claims is unknowable, but the tradition portrays faith as his central motivation.

- **Legacy:** The churches would endure. Lalibela built not for his own lifetime but for eternity — or at least for centuries. This orientation toward the future, toward posterity, is implicit in the nature of his achievement.

- **His People:** The "New Jerusalem" interpretation frames the project as pastoral care — providing Ethiopian Christians with sacred spaces for worship and pilgrimage. The king as shepherd of his flock.

- **Beauty and Craftsmanship:** The churches are not merely functional but beautiful. Decorative programs, harmonious proportions, careful details — these reflect a commitment to aesthetic excellence, not merely utilitarian construction.

- **Divine Mandate:** Lalibela apparently believed (or at least claimed) that God had commanded him to build. This sense of divine mission would have shaped his approach to opposition, obstacles, and the cost of the project.

**Potential Internal Conflicts for Fiction:**

- Faith vs. Pride: Building the greatest churches in Christendom could be an act of humility or an act of vanity. Did Lalibela struggle with this tension?
- Duty vs. Cost: The project consumed enormous resources. Were there moments when Lalibela questioned whether the cost to his people was justified?
- Vision vs. Practicality: The gap between the divine blueprint (if we accept the vision tradition) and earthly engineering realities. How did Lalibela respond when plans had to be modified?
- Brother vs. Brother: The fraught relationship with Harbe. Guilt? Anger? Forgiveness? The hagiography smooths this over; fiction need not.

## Sources

### Primary Sources

**The *Gadla Lalibela* (Acts of Lalibela):**
The essential source for Lalibela's life. This Ge'ez hagiography was composed well after Lalibela's death — perhaps in the fourteenth or fifteenth century — and follows hagiographic conventions: divine omens at birth, miraculous preservation from enemies, visionary experiences, holy death. It aims to edify rather than to document, presenting Lalibela as a saint rather than a historical figure.
- **Reliability:** [T] Traditional/Oral — valuable for how Lalibela was remembered and venerated, but not reliable for historical facts. Specific claims (dates, events, conversations) should be treated as tradition, not history.
- **Access:** Translated in: Jules Perruchon, *Vie de Lalibela, roi d'Éthiopie* (1892); selections in various scholarly works.

**Ethiopian Royal Traditions:**
Later Ethiopian sources mention Lalibela and the Zagwe dynasty, usually in the context of the Solomonic "restoration" of 1270. These sources are shaped by Solomonic-era propaganda but preserve some information.
- **Reliability:** [P] Probable for broad outlines; biased by Solomonic agenda.

**The Churches Themselves:**
The rock-hewn churches constitute material evidence that survives from Lalibela's era (or near it). Their design, engineering, and decorative programs tell us about the capabilities and aesthetic values of the builders, even when written sources are silent.
- **Reliability:** [E] Established as evidence for Zagwe-era architectural achievement, though dating specific phases of construction is difficult.

### Secondary Sources

**Sergew Hable Sellassie, *Ancient and Medieval Ethiopian History to 1270* (1972):**
Scholarly treatment of Ethiopian history before the Solomonic period, including the Zagwe dynasty. Important for placing Lalibela in his historical context.
- **Reliability:** [E] Standard scholarly work.

**Taddesse Tamrat, *Church and State in Ethiopia, 1270-1527* (1972):**
Though focused on the Solomonic period, provides essential background on the Zagwe-Solomonic transition and how Solomonic historians treated Zagwe predecessors.
- **Reliability:** [E] Foundational scholarly work.

**David Phillipson, *Ancient Churches of Ethiopia: Fourth-Fourteenth Centuries* (2009):**
Archaeological and architectural study of Ethiopian church buildings, including detailed analysis of Lalibela's churches. Essential for understanding the physical evidence.
- **Reliability:** [E] Leading archaeological authority.

**Ruth Plant, *Architecture of the Tigre, Ethiopia* (1985):**
Study of Ethiopian ecclesiastical architecture with attention to rock-hewn churches and Aksumite traditions.

**Paul Henze, *Layers of Time: A History of Ethiopia* (2000):**
Accessible narrative history with good treatment of the Zagwe period and Lalibela.
- **Reliability:** [P] Solid popular history.

**Stuart Munro-Hay, *Ethiopia: The Unknown Land* (2002):**
General introduction to Ethiopian history and culture, including discussion of Lalibela and the churches.
- **Reliability:** [P] Good general introduction.

### Source Assessment

The fundamental challenge in studying Lalibela is the gap between the material evidence (which is extraordinary and undeniable) and the documentary evidence (which is hagiographic and shaped by religious conventions). We can see what Lalibela built; we struggle to know who Lalibela was.

**What we know with confidence:**
- A Zagwe king (or kings) commissioned and completed the rock-hewn churches at the site now called Lalibela [E]
- The churches were completed by the thirteenth century at the latest [E]
- The king traditionally credited with the churches was named Lalibela and was later venerated as a saint [E]
- The churches were designed with Christian liturgical use in mind and possibly with Jerusalem symbolism [P]

**What we do not know:**
- Lalibela's exact reign dates [D]
- Whether all churches were built during his reign [D]
- Biographical details (childhood, exile, Jerusalem pilgrimage) — all come from hagiography [T]
- His personality, appearance, or character beyond hagiographic stereotypes [T]
