## Overview

The manuscript tradition of Timbuktu represents one of the most significant achievements of African intellectual history — a vast corpus of written knowledge produced, collected, copied, and preserved by generations of West African Muslim scholars from at least the fourteenth century onward. At its height in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, Timbuktu was a city where books were more valuable than gold, where scholars accumulated libraries of thousands of volumes, where professional copyists produced manuscripts for an eager market, and where the written word commanded a reverence comparable to that accorded holy relics in medieval Europe. This tradition was not an import from the Arab world but an indigenous African Islamic achievement: African scholars writing in Arabic and in African languages, addressing African concerns, building on centuries of local intellectual development. [E]

The manuscripts of Timbuktu covered the full range of Islamic learning. At their core stood the religious sciences: copies of the Quran in beautiful calligraphy, works of Quranic exegesis (*tafsir*), collections of prophetic traditions (*hadith*), treatises on Islamic jurisprudence (*fiqh*) in the Maliki school that predominated in West Africa. But the corpus extended far beyond religious texts. Timbuktu scholars wrote histories of their own region — the *tarikh* tradition that provides our most detailed knowledge of medieval West Africa. They composed biographical dictionaries documenting generations of scholars. They copied and commented on works of Arabic grammar, rhetoric, and poetry. They studied astronomy and mathematics, producing calendars, horoscopes, and geometrical treatises. They wrote on medicine, compiling remedies and anatomical knowledge. They maintained commercial records, diplomatic correspondence, and legal documents. The range was encyclopedic, reflecting an intellectual culture that valued knowledge in all its forms. [E]

The physical manuscripts themselves are objects of extraordinary beauty and historical importance. Written on imported paper using locally-made inks, bound in decorated leather covers, sometimes illuminated with gold and colored pigments, each volume represented an enormous investment of labor, materials, and skill. Manuscripts were family treasures, passed down through generations with marginal annotations recording who had studied the text and when. They were commercial commodities, bought and sold in Timbuktu's famous book markets. They were tools of education, the physical media through which knowledge was transmitted from teacher to student. And they were, in a profound sense, sacred objects — repositories of divine knowledge that commanded reverence and care. The destruction of Ahmad Baba's library of 1,600 volumes during the 1593 Moroccan arrests was experienced not merely as a personal loss but as a catastrophe for the entire scholarly community, a wound that the great scholar mourned until his death. [E]

## Historical Development

### Origins (Pre-1300 CE)

The Islamic scholarly tradition in the western Sudan predated Timbuktu's rise to prominence. Islam reached the Sahel through trans-Saharan trade, probably by the ninth century, and literate Muslim communities existed in cities like Ghana's capital (Koumbi Saleh), Walata, and Gao before Timbuktu achieved significance. The earliest manuscripts in the region were likely copies of the Quran and basic religious texts brought by North African traders and scholars. [P]

What distinguished Timbuktu's eventual development was not that literacy arrived there first — it did not — but that the city's commercial position and imperial patronage created the conditions for an exceptionally prolific and sustained manuscript tradition. The combination of wealth from the trans-Saharan trade, the availability of imported paper, the presence of a large scholarly community, and the patronage of successive empires transformed Timbuktu from a recipient of manuscripts into a major producer and center of the book trade. [P]

**Pre-Timbuktu Scholarly Centers:**

Before Timbuktu's rise, other Sahelian cities served as centers of Islamic learning:

- **Walata:** An important scholarly center before and alongside Timbuktu; some early scholars migrated from Walata to Timbuktu
- **Djenne:** A commercial and scholarly center in the Inland Niger Delta with its own manuscript tradition
- **Koumbi Saleh:** The capital of the Ghana Empire had a Muslim quarter with scholarly activity
- **Gao:** The Songhai capital maintained Islamic scholars alongside its political elite [P]

### The Mali Period (c. 1324-1433)

Timbuktu's transformation into a major center of manuscript production began under Mali Empire patronage, particularly during and after the reign of Mansa Musa (r. c. 1312-1337). Musa's famous 1324-1325 pilgrimage to Mecca brought him into contact with the intellectual centers of the Islamic heartland — Cairo, Mecca, Medina — and he returned with scholars, books, and the architect al-Sahili, who built or renovated Timbuktu's Djinguereber Mosque. [E]

**Mansa Musa's Impact:**

- Established Timbuktu as a center of royal patronage for Islamic learning
- Attracted scholars from North Africa and beyond with generous stipends
- Built infrastructure (mosques, residences) that supported scholarly activity
- Integrated Timbuktu into broader Islamic intellectual networks through diplomatic and commercial contacts
- Created conditions for manuscript accumulation and production [E]

**The Growing Book Trade:**

Under Mali rule, Timbuktu's book market began to develop. Manuscripts arriving from the Maghreb through the trans-Saharan trade joined locally-produced copies to create a growing supply of texts. Wealthy merchants and scholars began accumulating private libraries. The demand for manuscripts — both for study and as markers of status — created incentives for professional copying. [P]

### The Songhai Period (1468-1591): Golden Age

The Songhai Empire's conquest of Timbuktu in 1468 and the subsequent century of Songhai rule marked the golden age of the city's manuscript tradition. Under the Askia dynasty (1493-1591), Timbuktu achieved its greatest intellectual prominence, and the manuscript collections reached their peak extent. [E]

**Factors in the Golden Age:**

1. **Imperial Patronage:** The Askia rulers, particularly Askia Muhammad I (r. 1493-1528) and Askia Dawud (r. 1549-1582), actively supported Timbuktu's scholars. They provided stipends, gifts, and privileges; they consulted scholars on matters of law and governance; they collected manuscripts themselves. Askia Dawud is said to have had a personal library and to have memorized the Quran. [E]

2. **Economic Prosperity:** The Songhai Empire's control of the trans-Saharan trade routes brought wealth to Timbuktu. This wealth funded the importation of paper and other materials, paid for professional copying, and enabled scholars to devote their lives to study rather than manual labor. [E]

3. **Population Growth:** Timbuktu reached its peak population (perhaps 50,000-100,000) during this period, creating a large market for manuscripts and a large pool of potential students, scholars, and copyists. [S]

4. **Scholarly Networks:** Timbuktu's reputation attracted scholars from across the Islamic world. These visitors brought manuscripts, engaged in scholarly exchange, and spread knowledge of Timbuktu's learning throughout the Muslim world. [E]

5. **The Tarikh Tradition:** During this period, Timbuktu scholars began producing the historical chronicles — the *Tarikh al-Sudan* and *Tarikh al-Fattash* — that would become the most important primary sources for West African history. This historiographical tradition was distinctly Timbuktu in character. [E]

**Leo Africanus's Testimony:**

The Andalusian traveler Leo Africanus (al-Hasan ibn Muhammad al-Wazzan), who visited Timbuktu around 1510-1512, provided the most famous contemporary description of the book trade:

> "Here are great store of doctors, judges, priests, and other learned men, that are bountifully maintained at the King's cost and charges. And hither are brought diverse manuscripts or written books out of Barbary, which are sold for more money than any other merchandise." [E]

This passage has been cited countless times, but its significance bears emphasis: in Timbuktu, books were the most valuable commodity. Manuscripts commanded higher prices than gold, salt, textiles, or enslaved people. This valuation reflects both the material costs of production (paper, ink, leather, labor) and the cultural prestige accorded to written knowledge. [E]

**Peak Production:**

Estimates of manuscript production during the Songhai golden age are necessarily speculative, but the evidence suggests extraordinary productivity:

- Ahmad Baba's personal library of 1,600 volumes was one of the largest but not unique
- Multiple scholarly families (Aqit, Bagayogo, Kati) accumulated comparable collections
- Professional copyists produced manuscripts for the commercial market
- The three mosque-universities (Djinguereber, Sankore, Sidi Yahia) maintained institutional collections
- Visiting scholars and students acquired manuscripts to take home [E]

### The Moroccan Catastrophe (1591) and Its Aftermath

The Moroccan invasion of 1591 — the Battle of Tondibi that destroyed the Songhai army and the subsequent occupation of Timbuktu — represented a catastrophe for the manuscript tradition. The occupation was marked by violence against the scholarly community, the confiscation and destruction of libraries, and the exile of leading scholars including Ahmad Baba. [E]

**The 1593 Arrests:**

In August 1593, the Moroccan governor Pasha Mahmud Zarqun ordered the arrest of Ahmad Baba and other prominent scholars. The arrests were accompanied by the confiscation of their libraries:

- Ahmad Baba's library of 1,600 manuscripts was seized
- Some manuscripts were taken to Morocco as booty
- Others were scattered, sold, or destroyed
- The scholarly networks that had taken generations to build were disrupted [E]

Ahmad Baba's lament for his lost library, recorded in multiple sources, captures the magnitude of the loss:

> "Of all the people, I had the smallest library. My family's books — God curse whoever made them disappear — were confiscated." [E]

The phrase "the smallest library" is false modesty or comparison to his ancestors' collections, but the pain is authentic. Ahmad Baba mourned his books for the rest of his life, regarding their loss as a wound to his soul. [E]

**Long-Term Impact:**

The Moroccan occupation and the subsequent Arma period (when the descendants of Moroccan soldiers ruled the Niger Bend) did not entirely destroy Timbuktu's manuscript tradition, but they inflicted lasting damage:

- Many scholarly families fled to the countryside or other cities
- The networks of copying and transmission were disrupted
- Patronage declined as the Arma lacked the resources and interest of the Songhai rulers
- New production slowed dramatically
- Existing manuscripts became even more precious as the supply of new copies diminished [E]

Yet the tradition survived. Ahmad Baba returned from exile in 1608 and resumed teaching and writing. Other scholars remained in or returned to Timbuktu. The manuscript collections, diminished but not destroyed, continued to be preserved by families who understood their value. The *Tarikh al-Sudan*, completed around 1656, demonstrates that scholarly production continued even in reduced circumstances. [E]

### Survival and Transmission (1600-Present)

The centuries following the Moroccan conquest saw Timbuktu decline as a center of learning, but the manuscript heritage was preserved through a remarkable tradition of family custody. Scholarly families continued to safeguard their ancestors' libraries, passing them down through generations, maintaining them as sacred trusts. [E]

**Family Collections:**

The most important factor in manuscript survival was the system of family libraries:

- Descendants of great scholars kept their ancestors' books as family treasures
- Manuscripts were stored in family compounds, often in specially-designated rooms
- Knowledge of the collections was passed down within families
- The manuscripts were seen as sacred objects requiring special care [E]

This system preserved manuscripts through colonial occupation, independence, and the upheavals of modern Mali. Well into the twenty-first century, families in Timbuktu and across the Sahel maintained collections that had been in their custody for four centuries or more. [E]

**Threats to Survival:**

The surviving manuscripts face multiple ongoing threats:

- **Climate:** The Sahel's extreme heat, seasonal rains, and dust storms damage paper and bindings
- **Insects and Vermin:** Termites, silverfish, mice, and other pests consume paper and leather
- **Fire:** The risk of fire in mud-brick buildings with flammable storage materials
- **Theft and Sale:** Economic pressures have led some families to sell manuscripts, often to foreign collectors
- **Neglect:** As communities change and oral tradition about manuscript care is lost
- **Conflict:** Armed conflict, most recently during the 2012-2013 occupation [E]

## Manuscript Production

### Materials

**Paper:**

Paper was the most essential and most expensive material for manuscript production, and Timbuktu did not produce its own. All paper was imported, primarily from:

- **North Africa:** Moroccan and Tunisian paper, itself often made from European rags
- **Egypt:** Egyptian paper entering through trans-Saharan routes
- **Europe (indirect):** European paper, particularly from Italy and Spain, reached Timbuktu through North African intermediaries [E]

Paper quality varied significantly:

- **Best quality:** Smooth, thick, durable; reserved for Qurans and important texts
- **Medium quality:** Standard scholarly paper for most manuscripts
- **Poor quality:** Thinner, more fragile; used for draft copies, letters, and lesser works
- **Reused paper:** Palimpsests where earlier writing was washed off or scraped away [P]

The cost of paper was a significant factor limiting manuscript production. Paper was literally worth its weight in gold for the finest grades. This expense helps explain why manuscripts were so valuable and why their destruction was considered such a catastrophe. [E]

**Ink:**

Unlike paper, ink was produced locally in Timbuktu, using materials available in the region:

- **Gum arabic:** The primary binding agent, harvested from acacia trees common in the Sahel
- **Soot/Lampblack:** The black pigment, produced by burning oil or fat
- **Water:** For mixing the ink
- **Optional additives:** Vinegar or other substances to improve flow and preservation [P]

The quality of ink varied, and different formulas were used for different purposes. The best inks retained their deep black color over centuries; inferior inks faded to brown or reddish tones. Colored inks — red, blue, gold — were used for chapter headings, decorations, and illumination, but these were more expensive and less common. [P]

**Writing Instruments:**

Timbuktu scribes used the traditional Islamic reed pen (*qalam*), cut from reeds growing along the Niger River and its tributaries:

- Reeds were dried, cut to length, and shaped with a knife
- The nib was cut at an angle to produce the characteristic Arabic letter forms
- Different nib widths produced different scripts and letter sizes
- Scribes typically kept multiple pens for different purposes [P]

The reed pen requires constant resharpening as the nib wears down through use. Keeping pens sharp was a constant task for any working copyist. [P]

**Binding Materials:**

Manuscripts were bound in leather covers, typically:

- **Goat or sheep leather:** The most common binding material
- **Camel leather:** Sometimes used for larger volumes
- **Decorated leather:** Tooled, embossed, or dyed for important manuscripts [P]

Bindings were vulnerable to insect damage and wear. Many surviving manuscripts have been rebound multiple times over their history. [P]

### Calligraphy and Scripts

Timbuktu manuscripts employed several Arabic scripts, chosen according to the text's purpose and the copyist's training:

**Maghribi Script:**

The dominant script in West African manuscripts was the Maghribi (western) style, related to the scripts used in Morocco, al-Andalus, and the western Islamic world more generally. Characteristics include:

- Rounded letter forms
- Distinctive shapes for certain letters (especially qaf and fa)
- Flowing, cursive appearance
- Various sub-styles (Sudani, Saqi, etc.) developed locally [E]

**Sudani Scripts:**

Over centuries, West African scribes developed distinctive local variants of the Maghribi script, sometimes collectively called "Sudani" (relating to the Sudan, the Arabic term for the sub-Saharan region). These scripts represent African adaptations of the broader Islamic calligraphic tradition. [P]

**Mashriqi Scripts:**

Eastern (Mashriqi) scripts such as Naskh were known in Timbuktu but less commonly used than Maghribi. Manuscripts written in eastern scripts often came from or through Egypt and the Hijaz. [P]

**Skill Levels:**

The quality of calligraphy varied enormously:

- **Professional copyists:** Produced manuscripts of high quality for sale or commission
- **Scholars:** Copied texts for their own use, with quality depending on individual skill
- **Students:** Copied texts as part of their training, with highly variable results [P]

The most beautiful manuscripts — Qurans with carefully executed calligraphy and elaborate decorations — represented enormous investments of skilled labor. These manuscripts were treasures comparable to illuminated manuscripts in medieval Europe. [P]

### The Copying Process

**The Copyist's Work:**

Producing a manuscript was laborious, time-consuming work:

1. **Preparation:** Assemble materials (paper, ink, pens); prepare the master text; rule the paper if desired
2. **Copying:** Reproduce the text letter by letter, word by word; mark chapter divisions and structural elements
3. **Proofreading:** Check the copy against the master for errors; make corrections
4. **Decoration:** Add chapter headings, marginal markers, and illumination if appropriate
5. **Binding:** Sew the pages together; attach covers [P]

A copyist working full-time might produce a few pages per day, depending on the script size and complexity. A substantial work could take months to copy. [P]

**Colophons:**

Many manuscripts include colophons — notes at the end recording information about the copying:

- The copyist's name
- The date of completion
- The location where the copy was made
- Sometimes the name of the patron who commissioned the work
- Invocations of blessing on the copyist, reader, and owner [E]

Colophons are invaluable for dating manuscripts and tracing the transmission of texts. They also reveal something of the human beings who produced these works — their names, their locations, their sense of the importance of their labor. [E]

**Transmission Chains:**

The Islamic scholarly tradition placed great emphasis on *isnad* — chains of transmission connecting a text to its original author through an unbroken sequence of teacher-to-student transmission. Manuscripts often record these chains:

- "I heard this from [teacher's name], who heard it from [teacher's teacher's name], who heard it from..." etc.
- The chain might extend back through centuries to the Prophet Muhammad himself for hadith texts
- For other works, the chain connected the current copy to the original author [P]

These transmission chains served as authentication. A text with a strong, documented chain was considered more reliable than one without. The emphasis on transmission meant that copying was not merely mechanical reproduction but a form of scholarly participation in an ongoing tradition. [P]

### Professional Copyists

**The Copyist's Trade:**

Manuscript copying was a profession in Timbuktu, with copyists producing works for sale in the book market or on commission from patrons:

- Skilled copyists could make a living from their work
- Prices varied according to the length and complexity of the work, the quality of materials, and the copyist's reputation
- Some copyists specialized in particular types of texts (Qurans, legal works, etc.)
- The trade was distinct from, though overlapping with, the scholarly community [P]

**Training:**

Copyists learned their trade through apprenticeship, typically beginning as students who copied texts for their own education and gradually developing the skill and speed required for commercial production. The transition from student copying to professional copying was gradual rather than marked by any formal certification. [P]

**Economics:**

The economics of manuscript production help explain both the high value of books and the limitations on production:

- Paper costs were substantial (imported across the Sahara)
- A copyist's time was expensive (months of work for a single substantial volume)
- Materials (ink, leather for binding, decoration if any) added to costs
- The effective cost per copy was far higher than later print production [P]

This economic reality meant that manuscripts remained expensive luxury goods, accessible primarily to the wealthy, though the system of scholarly lending and sharing extended access somewhat beyond those who could afford to own books outright. [P]

## Languages and Scripts

### Arabic as Scholarly Language

Arabic served as the primary language of scholarship in Timbuktu, as throughout the Islamic world. This was not because Timbuktu's scholars were Arabs — most were not — but because Arabic was the language of Islamic revelation, of the classical scholarly tradition, and of communication across the vast Islamic world. [E]

**Why Arabic:**

- The Quran was revealed in Arabic; serious religious study required Arabic mastery
- The classical texts of Islamic scholarship — jurisprudence, theology, grammar — were in Arabic
- Arabic enabled communication with scholars across the Islamic world
- Arabic was the prestige language of Islamic civilization [E]

**Arabic Proficiency:**

Timbuktu scholars mastered classical Arabic at a level that impressed visitors from the Arab heartlands. Ahmad Baba, for example, wrote Arabic with elegance and precision comparable to any scholar of the Maghreb or Middle East. This mastery was the product of rigorous training in grammar, rhetoric, and the Arabic literary tradition. [E]

**Local Arabic:**

Alongside classical written Arabic, a local Arabic vernacular developed for everyday use among Timbuktu's Arabic-speaking population. This vernacular was influenced by the local African languages and had its own distinctive features. However, scholarly writing remained in classical Arabic. [P]

### Ajami: African Languages in Arabic Script

One of the most distinctive features of the Timbuktu manuscript tradition — and of West African Islamic literacy more broadly — was the use of Arabic script to write African languages. This practice is known as Ajami (from the Arabic word *'ajam*, meaning "non-Arab" or "foreign"). [E]

**What is Ajami:**

Ajami writing adapts the Arabic alphabet to represent the sounds of African languages that the Arabic alphabet was not designed for. This required:

- Using existing Arabic letters for sounds that exist in both languages
- Adapting Arabic letters (with diacritical marks or modifications) for sounds that don't exist in Arabic
- Developing conventions for representing tones (in tonal languages) [E]

**Languages Written in Ajami:**

In the Timbuktu region and the broader western Sudan, Ajami was used to write:

- **Fulfulde/Pulaar:** The language of the Fulani people
- **Hausa:** The major language of the central Sahel
- **Songhai:** The dominant language of the Timbuktu region
- **Manding (Bambara, Dyula, etc.):** The languages of the Mande peoples
- **Tamashek:** The Berber language of the Tuareg
- **Wolof:** In Senegambia [E]

**Types of Ajami Texts:**

Ajami manuscripts include:

- **Religious texts:** Prayers, devotional poetry, simplified religious instruction for those who could not read classical Arabic
- **Poetry:** Devotional and secular verse in African languages
- **Historical texts:** Local histories and chronicles
- **Personal documents:** Letters, commercial records, notes
- **Translations:** Arabic texts translated into African languages [P]

**Significance of Ajami:**

The Ajami tradition demonstrates that West African Islamic literacy was not simply an import from the Arab world but a creative adaptation that made literacy accessible to speakers of African languages. A person could be literate in Ajami without mastering classical Arabic — the bar for entry to literate culture was lowered. This significantly expanded the potential literate community. [E]

Ajami also preserved African languages in written form. Without Ajami, the sounds of medieval Fulfulde, Hausa, or Songhai would be known only through later reconstruction. Ajami manuscripts provide direct evidence of how these languages were spoken centuries ago. [E]

**Ajami and the Manuscript Corpus:**

A significant portion of surviving Timbuktu-region manuscripts are in Ajami rather than Arabic. Estimates vary, but perhaps 10-20% of the total corpus may be Ajami texts. This percentage may be higher for personal and popular documents, lower for formal scholarly works. [S]

### Multi-Lingual Manuscripts

Many Timbuktu manuscripts are multilingual, combining Arabic and Ajami within a single document:

- **Interlinear glosses:** Arabic text with explanations in a local language written between the lines
- **Marginal notes:** Annotations in a different language from the main text
- **Code-switching:** Documents that shift between languages for different purposes
- **Translations alongside original:** Parallel Arabic and Ajami versions [P]

These multilingual features reflect the reality of Timbuktu's scholarly community — scholars who moved fluently between Arabic and their native African languages, using whichever was appropriate for the context. [P]

## Subjects and Contents

### Religious Sciences

The core of the Timbuktu manuscript corpus consisted of religious texts — the sciences necessary for understanding and practicing Islam:

**Quran and Quranic Sciences:**

- Copies of the Quran, ranging from plain study copies to elaborately illuminated masterpieces
- Works of Quranic exegesis (*tafsir*), explaining the meaning of the sacred text
- Treatises on Quranic recitation (*tajwid*), the rules for proper pronunciation and intonation

The Timbuktu scholars produced a distinctive historiographical tradition — works of history focused on their own region and its place in the Islamic world:

**The Tarikh Tradition:**

- *Tarikh al-Sudan* (Chronicle of the Sudan), written by Abd al-Rahman al-Sa'di (c. 1596-c. 1656)
- *Tarikh al-Fattash* (Chronicle of the Seeker after Knowledge), begun by Mahmud Kati (d. 1593), continued by descendants

These chronicles are the most important primary sources for medieval West African history, providing detailed information about the Mali and Songhai empires, their rulers, wars, and scholarly communities. They represent an indigenous African Islamic historiographical tradition distinct from the Arabic chronicles written by outsiders. [E]

**Biographical Dictionaries:**

- Works documenting the lives of scholars, saints, and rulers
- Ahmad Baba's *Nayl al-Ibtihaj*, a biographical dictionary of Maliki scholars

**Royal Chronicles:**

- Records of rulers and their reigns
- Genealogies of ruling families
- Administrative and political documents [P]

### Linguistic Sciences

Arabic grammar and rhetoric were essential subjects in Islamic education, and Timbuktu scholars produced extensive works in these fields:

**Grammar (Nahw):**

- Commentaries on the standard grammatical texts (the *Alfiyya* of Ibn Malik, etc.)
- Original treatises on grammatical questions
- Teaching materials for Arabic instruction [P]

**Morphology (Sarf):**

- Works on Arabic word forms and derivation
- Verb conjugation tables and references [P]

**Rhetoric (Balagha):**

### Poetry and Literature

**Religious Poetry:**

- Devotional verses praising the Prophet Muhammad
- Sufi poetry on spiritual themes
- Didactic poetry presenting religious teachings in memorable verse form [P]

**Panegyric Poetry:**

- Praise poems for rulers and patrons
- Elegies for deceased scholars and leaders [P]

**Personal and Occasional Poetry:**

- Correspondence in verse
- Occasional poems marking events
- Personal reflections and meditations [P]

### Commercial and Legal Documents

Beyond formal scholarly works, the Timbuktu corpus includes documents from everyday life:

**Commercial Records:**

- Contracts and agreements
- Debt records
- Property transactions
- Trade accounts [P]

**Legal Documents:**

- Court records
- Marriage contracts and divorce documents
- Manumission papers freeing enslaved people
- Inheritance distributions [P]

**Correspondence:**

- Letters between scholars
- Diplomatic correspondence
- Personal letters [P]

These documents, often overlooked in favor of literary manuscripts, provide invaluable evidence for social and economic history. [P]

## The Great Libraries

### Family Collections

The heart of Timbuktu's manuscript heritage was its family libraries — collections accumulated over generations by scholarly families and maintained as sacred trusts:

**The Aqit Library:**

Ahmad Baba's family, the Aqits, were among the most distinguished scholarly families of Timbuktu. Their library, accumulated over five generations, included the 1,600 volumes that Ahmad Baba described (as an understatement, he suggested) as "the smallest" of his family's collections. The Aqit library was partially destroyed or scattered during the 1593 arrests, but descendants preserved portions that survived. [E]

**The Kati Library:**

The Kati family, descendants of the historian Mahmud Kati, maintained one of the most important family collections. The *Tarikh al-Fattash* was itself a Kati family project, and the family library included not only their own chronicle but extensive materials on the history and scholarship of the region. The Kati collection survives today and has been the focus of preservation efforts. [E]

**The Bagayogo Library:**

The Bagayogo family, another distinguished scholarly lineage, maintained a significant collection. Muhammad Bagayogo (d. 1593), Ahmad Baba's teacher and uncle, possessed an extensive library that influenced Ahmad Baba's own scholarly formation. [P]

**Characteristics of Family Libraries:**

These family collections shared certain features:

- **Generational accumulation:** Libraries grew over generations as each scholarly generation added new acquisitions
- **Inheritance patterns:** Libraries passed from father to son (or occasionally nephew), with provisions for division among heirs
- **Sacred status:** The manuscripts were treated as sacred objects requiring special care
- **Restricted access:** Access was typically limited to family members and trusted scholars
- **Oral knowledge:** Information about the contents and significance of manuscripts was transmitted orally within families [P]

### Mosque Libraries

The three great mosques of Timbuktu — Djinguereber, Sankore, and Sidi Yahia — maintained institutional collections:

**Sankore:**

As the center of scholarly activity, Sankore Mosque accumulated works needed for teaching and reference. These included:

- Multiple copies of texts used in instruction
- Reference works for scholars and students
- Donated manuscripts from deceased scholars or departing visitors [P]

**Djinguereber:**

The royal mosque maintained collections reflecting its official status:

- Presentation copies of Qurans and religious texts
- Works associated with visiting dignitaries
- Documents related to the mosque's administration [P]

**Sidi Yahia:**

The smallest of the three mosques maintained a more modest collection focused on community religious needs. [P]

### The Ahmed Baba Institute (IHERI-AB)

The Institut des Hautes Etudes et de Recherches Islamiques de Ahmed Baba (IHERI-AB), commonly known as the Ahmed Baba Institute, is the primary institutional repository for Timbuktu manuscripts today:

**History:**

- Founded in 1973 under Malian government auspices
- Named after Ahmad Baba al-Timbukti
- Initially focused on collecting and cataloguing manuscripts from private collections
- Expanded to include conservation, digitization, and research [E]

**Collections:**

As of 2012 (before the Islamist occupation), the institute held approximately 30,000 manuscripts:

- Acquired through purchase, donation, and deposit
- Representing a fraction of the total surviving corpus
- Catalogued and (partially) conserved [E]

**Challenges:**

The institute has faced numerous challenges:

- Inadequate funding for conservation and cataloguing
- Climate-control difficulties in the Sahelian environment
- The 2012-2013 occupation, which threatened the collections
- Competition with private collectors and foreign institutions seeking to acquire manuscripts [E]

## The Tarikh Tradition

### Origins and Character

The *tarikh* (historical chronicle) tradition of Timbuktu represents a distinctive contribution to Islamic historiography — histories written by African scholars about African subjects, using the conventions of Islamic historical writing but focused on local concerns. [E]

**What Makes the Tarikh Tradition Distinctive:**

1. **Local Perspective:** Unlike Arabic sources on West Africa (al-Bakri, Ibn Battuta, Leo Africanus), which represent outsiders' observations, the *tarikhs* present an insider view of West African society

2. **Continuous Narrative:** The chronicles provide connected historical narrative rather than scattered observations

3. **Scholarly Focus:** The *tarikhs* devote extensive attention to scholars, their lineages, and their intellectual contributions

4. **Religious Framework:** History is understood within an Islamic framework, with events interpreted in relation to divine providence and Islamic norms

5. **Regional Pride:** The chronicles reflect pride in Timbuktu's achievements and grief at its destruction [E]

### *Tarikh al-Sudan*

**Author:** Abd al-Rahman al-Sa'di (c. 1596 - c. 1656)

**Composition:** The chronicle was completed around 1656, drawing on earlier written sources, oral tradition, and the author's own experience

**Content:** The *Tarikh al-Sudan* covers:

- The history of the western Sudan from legendary origins
- The Mali Empire
- The Songhai Empire in detail
- The Moroccan conquest and occupation
- Extensive information about Timbuktu's scholarly community [E]

**Significance:**

Al-Sa'di was a student of Ahmad Baba and a participant in the events he describes. His chronicle is the single most important source for Songhai history and for Timbuktu's scholarly golden age. Without the *Tarikh al-Sudan*, our knowledge of medieval West Africa would be drastically impoverished. [E]

**Translation:** John O. Hunwick, *Timbuktu and the Songhay Empire: Al-Sa'di's Ta'rikh al-Sudan down to 1613, and Other Contemporary Documents* (Brill, 1999) [E]

### *Tarikh al-Fattash*

**Authors:** Begun by Mahmud Kati (d. 1593); continued by his descendants through at least the seventeenth century

**Composition:** The chronicle was a family project, with different sections written at different times

**Content:** The *Tarikh al-Fattash* covers similar ground to the *Tarikh al-Sudan* but with different emphases and additional material:

- Pre-Islamic history and legend
- The Mali and Songhai empires
- Particular attention to the role of scholars in governance
- The Moroccan conquest from the perspective of a family directly affected [E]

**Textual Complications:**

The *Tarikh al-Fattash* presents complex textual problems. The surviving manuscripts appear to include later interpolations and additions, and scholars debate which portions represent Mahmud Kati's original work and which are later additions by descendants or even by scribes with political agendas. [D]

**Significance:**

Despite its textual complexities, the *Tarikh al-Fattash* provides invaluable information not found in other sources, particularly regarding the relationship between scholars and political authority. [E]

## Illumination and Decoration

### Decorative Traditions

The finest Timbuktu manuscripts display sophisticated decorative programs, particularly for Qurans and other prestigious texts:

**Geometric Patterns:**

- Interlocking geometric designs based on Islamic geometric principles
- Border patterns framing text pages
- Carpet pages (full-page decorative spreads, typically at chapter openings) [P]

**Vegetal Motifs:**

- Stylized floral patterns
- Arabesque designs
- Palm and acacia motifs reflecting local vegetation [P]

**Color:**

Decorated manuscripts employed colored inks and pigments:

- Red: Most common color after black; used for chapter headings, verse markers, important words
- Blue: Used for headings and decorative elements
- Gold: Applied as gold leaf or gold ink to the most prestigious manuscripts
- Green: Less common; associated with religious significance
- Yellow/Orange: Used decoratively [P]

**Calligraphic Display:**

- Enlarged script for chapter openings
- Display scripts (larger, more formal versions of standard scripts)
- Framed text blocks [P]

### Regional Style

Timbuktu illumination shows characteristics of the broader Maghribi tradition while developing local features:

**Maghribi Connections:**

- Shared geometric vocabulary with Moroccan and Andalusian traditions
- Similar color palettes
- Common structural elements (chapter headings, verse markers) [P]

**Local Developments:**

- Incorporation of local motifs
- Development of distinctive border patterns
- Adaptation to locally-available materials [P]

**Comparison:**

Timbuktu illumination differs from the eastern Islamic traditions (Persian, Ottoman, Mughal) in its:

- Greater emphasis on geometric rather than figural decoration
- More restrained color palette
- Different proportional systems [P]

### Function of Decoration

Decoration served multiple purposes:

**Religious:**

- Beautifying the sacred text (especially Qurans) was itself an act of devotion
- Illumination marked the holiness of the object

**Functional:**

- Chapter headings and verse markers aided navigation
- Visual hierarchy indicated text structure

**Economic:**

- Decorated manuscripts commanded higher prices
- Elaborate illumination demonstrated the patron's wealth and piety

**Prestige:**

- Fine decoration enhanced a manuscript's status as a family treasure
- Gift manuscripts for rulers or scholars were heavily decorated [P]

---

## Destruction and Survival

### The 1591 Catastrophe

The Moroccan invasion and its aftermath inflicted the greatest single blow to Timbuktu's manuscript heritage:

**Immediate Losses:**

- Libraries looted during the initial occupation
- Manuscripts confiscated during the 1593 arrests of scholars
- Books scattered as scholarly families fled
- Destruction during the violence of occupation [E]

**Ahmad Baba's Loss:**

Ahmad Baba's library of 1,600 volumes — one of the largest in the city — was confiscated. His repeated lamentations for this loss testify to its magnitude:

- Some manuscripts were taken to Morocco as booty
- Others were scattered and sold
- Many were simply destroyed
- The intellectual accumulation of five generations was dispersed in days [E]

**Long-Term Impact:**

The 1591 catastrophe did not destroy the manuscript tradition, but it inflicted lasting damage:

- The absolute number of manuscripts declined
- Production capacity was diminished
- Scholarly networks for copying and transmission were disrupted
- The economic base for manuscript production was weakened [E]

### Centuries of Attrition

Beyond the 1591 catastrophe, Timbuktu's manuscripts have faced continuous attrition:

**Environmental Damage:**

- Heat and humidity causing paper deterioration
- Insect and vermin damage
- Water damage during occasional floods or leaking roofs
- Sand and dust infiltration [E]

**Fire:**

- Individual fires destroying specific collections
- The risk inherent in mud-brick buildings with wooden elements [P]

**Sale and Dispersal:**

- Manuscripts sold during economic hardship
- Collections divided among heirs over generations
- Sales to foreign collectors, particularly in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries [P]

**Neglect:**

- As communities changed and oral tradition was lost
- As heirs lost understanding of manuscripts' significance
- As resources for proper storage and care diminished [P]

### The 2012-2013 Crisis

The most recent major threat to Timbuktu's manuscripts came during the 2012-2013 occupation by Ansar Dine and allied Islamist groups:

**The Occupation:**

In January 2012, Tuareg rebels and Islamist groups seized northern Mali, including Timbuktu. The Islamists imposed harsh rule and began destroying sites they considered un-Islamic, including Sufi shrines and tombs. The manuscripts faced potential destruction as objects the Islamists might consider idolatrous or heretical. [E]

**The Evacuation:**

In a remarkable rescue operation, local librarians and family custodians secretly evacuated large portions of the manuscript collections before the Islamists could destroy them:

- Manuscripts were hidden in houses, moved to Bamako, or otherwise protected
- The Ahmed Baba Institute's collections were largely saved
- Many family collections were similarly evacuated
- The operation relied on local courage and international support [E]

**Losses:**

Despite the evacuation, some manuscripts were lost:

- Some Ahmed Baba Institute manuscripts were burned by retreating Islamists
- Collections that could not be evacuated were damaged or destroyed
- The exact extent of losses remains unclear [E]

**Aftermath:**

Since French military intervention ended the occupation in early 2013:

- Manuscripts have been gradually returned to Timbuktu
- International attention has increased funding for preservation
- The vulnerability of the collections has been dramatically demonstrated
- Efforts at digitization have accelerated [E]

## Modern Preservation

### Cataloguing and Discovery

A fundamental challenge for Timbuktu manuscript preservation is simply identifying what exists:

**Known Collections:**

The Ahmed Baba Institute and several other institutional collections have been largely catalogued, but these represent only a fraction of the total corpus. [E]

**Private Collections:**

Hundreds of family collections throughout Timbuktu and across the Sahel remain in private hands, often uncatalogued:

- Families may be reluctant to reveal their holdings
- Collections may be dispersed across multiple locations
- Documentation of contents and conditions is often lacking [E]

**Discovery:**

New collections continue to be discovered:

- Families revealing holdings they had kept private
- Collections emerging from villages outside Timbuktu
- Manuscripts appearing in unexpected locations (hidden during conflicts, carried during migrations) [E]

### Conservation

Preserving physical manuscripts requires specialized expertise and resources:

**Environmental Control:**

- Managing temperature and humidity in the Sahelian environment
- Protecting against dust and sand
- Controlling light exposure [E]

**Pest Management:**

- Protecting against termites, silverfish, and other insects
- Preventing rodent damage
- Treatment of already-infested materials [P]

**Physical Repair:**

- Reinforcing fragile paper
- Rebinding damaged books
- Treating mold and water damage [P]

**Storage:**

- Archival-quality boxes and folders
- Climate-controlled storage facilities
- Proper shelving and organization [P]

**Challenges:**

Conservation in Timbuktu faces severe challenges:

- Extreme climate difficult to control
- Limited electricity and infrastructure
- Distance from specialized conservation facilities
- Funding constraints
- Security concerns [E]

### Digitization

Digitization — creating high-quality digital images of manuscripts — has become a central strategy for preservation:

**Advantages:**

- Creates backup copies that cannot be destroyed by local disasters
- Enables remote access for scholars
- Reduces handling of fragile originals
- Preserves visual information even if originals deteriorate
- Facilitates cataloguing and research [E]

**Major Projects:**

Several major digitization initiatives have targeted Timbuktu manuscripts:

- **The Timbuktu Manuscripts Project:** A long-running effort supported by various international donors
- **Hamburg University Project:** German academic initiative for digitization and study
- **Library of Congress Assistance:** American support for preservation
- **Various NGO Efforts:** Multiple non-governmental organizations have supported digitization [E]

**Challenges:**

- Scale of the task (hundreds of thousands of manuscripts)
- Varied conditions of originals (some too fragile to handle)
- Access to private collections
- Technical infrastructure in Timbuktu
- Long-term storage and accessibility of digital files
- Funding sustainability [E]

**Access Issues:**

Digitization raises questions about access:

- Who controls digitized images?
- How should access be balanced between preservation (limiting physical handling) and scholarly use?
- What are the rights of family custodians versus institutional repositories?
- How should digital collections be made available internationally while respecting local ownership? [D]

### International Support

Timbuktu manuscript preservation has attracted significant international attention and funding:

**UNESCO:**

- Timbuktu is a World Heritage Site
- Manuscripts are recognized under the Memory of the World programme
- UNESCO has supported conservation and training [E]

**Foreign Governments:**

- Norway, Luxembourg, Germany, the United States, and other governments have provided support
- International aid has funded conservation facilities, training, and digitization [E]

**Private Foundations:**

- The Ford Foundation, Mellon Foundation, and others have contributed
- Private donors have supported specific projects [P]

**Academic Institutions:**

- Universities in Europe, the United States, and elsewhere have partnered on research and preservation
- Academic programs train Malian conservators and scholars [E]

**Tensions:**

International involvement raises sensitive issues:

- Colonial-era acquisitions: Some Timbuktu manuscripts were taken during the colonial period and remain in European libraries
- Control and ownership: Tension between international institutions and local custodians
- Sustainability: Dependence on foreign funding creates vulnerability
- Local capacity: Balancing international expertise with building local skills [D]

## For Fiction Writing

### Scribes at Work

**The Copyist's Environment:**

A copyist working in Timbuktu would have worked in conditions shaped by the climate and available technology:

- **Workspace:** A small room or corner, perhaps near a window for light, but shaded from direct sun
- **Seating:** Cross-legged on a mat or cushion, the work surface (a low table or writing board) before him
- **Materials:** Paper stored carefully away from dust; ink in a small pot; multiple reed pens; a knife for sharpening pens and scraping errors
- **Light:** Working during daylight hours, or by oil lamp for extended sessions
- **Posture:** Bent over the work, the pen moving steadily across the page
- **Pace:** Slow by modern standards; a few pages per day for careful work [P]

**Sensory Details:**

- **Sight:** The white or cream-colored paper marked gradually with black ink; the precision of Arabic calligraphy; dust motes in slanting light
- **Sound:** The quiet scratch of the reed pen; the occasional sound of the knife resharpening the nib; street sounds filtering through
- **Smell:** Ink (gum arabic, soot, perhaps vinegar); leather bindings; the ever-present dust; perhaps incense burning nearby
- **Touch:** The smooth paper under the hand steadying the page; the warmth of the air; the pen between thumb and fingers
- **Taste:** Tea, heavily sweetened, brought by a servant or family member; the copyist wetting his lips before beginning a new section [P]

**The Copyist's Day:**

A professional copyist's day might include:

- Early morning: Begin work as soon as light permits; the coolest hours are best for concentration
- Mid-morning: Continue copying; perhaps receive a visitor (a patron checking on progress, a fellow scholar)
- Midday: Stop for the midday prayer; rest during the worst heat
- Afternoon: Resume work as temperatures drop; the light from the west now
- Evening: Work by lamplight if the deadline presses; review the day's work
- Night: Sleep, with the manuscript carefully stored away from dust and insects [P]

### Library Scenes

**Entering a Private Library:**

A visitor to a scholar's library in sixteenth-century Timbuktu would encounter:

- **The Approach:** A modest exterior; a door in a mud-brick wall giving no hint of the treasures within
- **The Entrance:** A servant or family member greeting the visitor; the requirement to remove sandals
- **The Space:** A room lined with shelves or niches; manuscripts stacked horizontally, spines facing out; perhaps a few open volumes on low tables
- **The Smell:** Old paper, leather, ink; a distinctive musty-sweet odor of aged manuscripts
- **The Light:** Dim, to protect the books; perhaps a single window, shaded
- **The Sound:** Quiet; the rustle of pages; perhaps the distant call to prayer
- **The Host:** The scholar-owner, proud of his collection but also protective; explaining the provenance and significance of particular volumes [P]

**Using a Manuscript:**

A scholar studying in a library would:

- Request the specific text from the librarian or owner
- Receive the volume with due reverence
- Find a suitable spot with adequate light
- Open the book carefully, supporting the binding
- Read silently or aloud in a low murmur (the Arabic scholarly tradition often involved vocalization)
- Perhaps take notes on a separate sheet or in the margins
- Return the volume to its place when finished [P]

**The Public Teaching Circle:**

Near the mosques, teaching circles brought manuscripts to public use:

- The master seated with a manuscript open before him
- Students arranged in a semicircle, some with their own copies, others listening
- The master reading aloud, then explicating the text
- Students asking questions, offering comments
- The rustle of turning pages, the murmur of recitation
- This continued for hours, day after day, text by text [P]

### The Books Themselves

**Physical Description:**

A typical Timbuktu manuscript might be:

- **Size:** Approximately 20 x 15 cm (8 x 6 inches) for a standard text; Qurans could be larger or smaller
- **Thickness:** From a few pages to several hundred, depending on the work
- **Binding:** Leather covers, typically reddish-brown, tooled with geometric patterns
- **Pages:** Paper pages, varying from cream to brown with age; ink ranging from deep black to faded brown
- **Layout:** Text in a single column or multiple columns; marginal notes in smaller script; chapter headings in red or other colors
- **Condition:** Depending on age and care — from pristine to worm-eaten, water-stained, or fragmentary [P]

**Individual Character:**

Each manuscript had its own history and personality:

- The colophon recording the copyist's name and the date
- Marginal notes from generations of owners and readers
- Stains and wear marks showing where the book was held and studied
- Repairs and rebindings testifying to care over centuries
- Each volume was unique, irreplaceable, a physical link to the past [P]

**The Value of Books:**

In fiction, the value of manuscripts provides dramatic possibilities:

- A scholar's wealth was in his books, not in gold
- The loss of a library was a catastrophe equivalent to financial ruin
- Stealing books was a grave crime
- Giving books was a mark of the highest honor
- A manuscript inherited from a famous ancestor was a priceless treasure [P]

### Dramatic Possibilities

**The Scholarly Quest:**

A scholar seeking a particular rare text:

- Hearing rumors that a copy exists in a certain collection
- Negotiating access with a reluctant owner
- The moment of discovery — or disappointment
- The laborious process of copying the text before it must be returned
- The chain of transmission: "I copied this from [owner's name], who had it from..."

**The Copyist's Dilemma:**

A copyist commissioned to produce a controversial work:

- The tension between the patron's demands and the copyist's scruples
- A text that might be heretical, politically dangerous, or morally dubious
- The colophon as a record that might incriminate
- The decision to complete, refuse, or anonymize the work

**The Inheritance:**

A family collection passing to the next generation:

- The deathbed transfer of library responsibilities
- Disputes among heirs over division of the manuscripts
- The tension between keeping the collection intact and selling it in hard times
- The obligation to preserve what ancestors accumulated

**The Destruction:**

The Moroccan conquest provides ready-made drama:

- Soldiers looting a library, throwing manuscripts into the street
- A scholar frantically hiding his most precious volumes
- The march into exile with nothing but memories of lost books
- Returning years later to find the collection scattered

**The Discovery:**

Modern scenes of manuscript discovery:

- A foreign scholar negotiating access to a family collection
- An old trunk opened after generations, revealing forgotten treasures
- The moment of identification: "This is unknown — this could change everything we know about..."
- The tension between preservation and exploitation, local ownership and international scholarship

### Character Possibilities

**The Master Copyist:**

An elderly copyist who has spent his life producing manuscripts:

- Deep pride in his craft, combined with humility before the tradition
- Hands worn from decades of pen-work
- Eyes weakening but memory sharp
- Training the next generation with exacting standards
- Mourning the decline of the craft in changed times

**The Young Scholar:**

A student seeking education in Timbuktu's golden age:

- Arriving from a distant village, awed by the city's learning
- Attaching himself to a master, copying texts as part of his training
- The slow mastery of Arabic calligraphy
- Dreams of building his own library, becoming a master himself
- The tension between scholarly ambition and family obligations

**The Merchant-Collector:**

A wealthy trader who collects manuscripts:

- The combination of commercial and intellectual interests
- Using wealth to acquire rare texts
- Patronizing copyists and scholars
- The manuscript collection as both investment and status symbol
- The question of what happens to the collection after death

**The Custodian:**

A family member charged with preserving an inherited collection:

- The weight of ancestral expectations
- Practical challenges of conservation in a difficult environment
- Economic pressures to sell versus duty to preserve
- The gradual loss of knowledge about what the collection contains
- Modern decisions about digitization, institutional deposit, international access

## Scholarly Debates

| Question | Position A | Position B | Current Consensus |
|----------|------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Number of surviving manuscripts** | 300,000-400,000 | 700,000-1,000,000+ | [S] Estimates vary widely; comprehensive survey impossible under current conditions |
| **Proportion of Ajami texts** | 10-15% of total corpus | 20-30% or higher | [D] Unknown; likely higher among popular/personal documents |
| **Extent of 1591 losses** | Catastrophic; majority of pre-conquest manuscripts lost | Significant but not total; much survived | [D] Probably significant losses, but substantial pre-conquest material survives |
| **2012-2013 losses** | Extensive destruction occurred | Most manuscripts evacuated successfully | [P] Most were saved, but some losses occurred; full assessment incomplete |
| **Best preservation strategy** | Centralized institutional collection (Ahmed Baba Institute) | Support for family collections in situ | [D] Both needed; balance between institutional capacity and traditional custody |
| **Digitization as solution** | Essential preservation measure | Incomplete solution; originals must be preserved | [E] Both true; digitization important but not sufficient |

### The Numbers Debate

The commonly-cited figure of "hundreds of thousands" of surviving Timbuktu manuscripts is frequently repeated but difficult to verify:

**Arguments for Higher Estimates:**

- Many private collections remain uncatalogued and undocumented
- Collections outside Timbuktu proper (in villages, in other cities) may be extensive
- New discoveries continue to emerge
- Family collections may be larger than publicly acknowledged [D]

**Arguments for Lower Estimates:**

- Higher figures may result from double-counting (the same manuscripts counted by different surveys)
- Many items counted as "manuscripts" may be fragments or single pages
- Losses from climate, insects, and conflict have been ongoing
- Some reported collections may not exist or may have been dispersed [D]

**The Honest Answer:**

We do not know how many manuscripts survive, and a comprehensive census is impossible under current conditions. The range of estimates (300,000 to 1,000,000+) reflects genuine uncertainty, not carelessness. [D]

### Ownership and Access

A significant ongoing debate concerns who should control Timbuktu's manuscripts and who should have access:

**Family Custody Model:**

Traditional family custody has preserved manuscripts for centuries. Families argue:

- They are the rightful owners of ancestral collections
- They have preserved the manuscripts through colonial rule, independence, and conflict
- Institutional collection separates manuscripts from their cultural context
- International interest sometimes resembles colonial extraction [D]

**Institutional Model:**

Institutional repositories (Ahmed Baba Institute, international libraries) argue:

- Professional conservation facilities protect manuscripts better
- Cataloguing and digitization require institutional capacity
- Scholarly access advances knowledge
- Some family collections have been sold, dispersed, or neglected [D]

**Current Practice:**

The current situation involves both models:

- The Ahmed Baba Institute holds approximately 30,000 manuscripts
- Hundreds of private collections remain in family custody
- Various partnerships attempt to support private collections while cataloguing and digitizing
- International institutions hold some manuscripts (acquired in various ways, some controversial) [E]
