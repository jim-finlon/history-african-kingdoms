## Overview

Music pervaded every dimension of life in Sub-Saharan African societies during our period. It marked the great transitions — birth, initiation, marriage, death — and accompanied the ordinary rhythms of daily existence: grinding grain, tending cattle, walking long distances. It announced the presence of kings and invoked the power of spirits. It preserved history, transmitted knowledge, and regulated social behavior. To understand these civilizations without understanding their musical cultures is to see only shadows on the wall.

Yet reconstructing the historical soundscape of African kingdoms presents formidable challenges. Unlike visual art (bronzes, terracottas, architecture) or written texts, music leaves no direct trace. We cannot hear a praise song performed for Sundiata, a hymn sung in Aksumite churches, or the drums that announced the Mwene Mutapa's approach. What survives is inference: later ethnographic documentation of traditions that claim ancient roots, iconographic evidence (instruments depicted in art), material remains of instruments, and scattered references in written sources. From these fragments, we reconstruct what we can.

This document synthesizes what can reasonably be said about music, dance, and performance traditions in Sub-Saharan Africa during the period 300-1600 CE. Much of what follows is [Speculative] — based on documented later traditions projected backward with appropriate caution. Where evidence is stronger, we note it. The goal is not false certainty but informed imagination: to provide a foundation for understanding (and for fiction writers, for depicting) a world where sound was as meaningful as sight.

## Methodological Note: Reconstructing Historical Music

### The Problem of Evidence

Historical musicology for Sub-Saharan Africa faces a fundamental gap: we have no recordings, no notated scores (with the partial exception of Ethiopian chant), and limited written descriptions from the period. Arabic travelers occasionally mentioned music, but their observations are brief and filtered through cultural unfamiliarity. Ethiopian church sources document liturgical practice but tell us little about secular music. European accounts, which become available after 1400, provide more detail but arrive late in our period and carry their own biases.

### Approaches to Reconstruction

Scholars use several strategies to reconstruct historical musical practices:

**Ethnomusicological Inference [S]:** The most common approach involves documenting twentieth-century and contemporary traditional music, then projecting backward. This rests on the assumption that oral musical traditions preserve older practices. The assumption has limits — traditions evolve, borrow, and innovate — but where a practice is documented across wide areas, shows consistency over generations of ethnographic observation, and fits the social contexts known to have existed historically, backward projection is reasonable if explicitly acknowledged as speculative.

**Iconographic Evidence [P]:** Instruments depicted in artwork (Benin bronzes, Ife terracottas, rock paintings) provide visual confirmation that certain instrument types existed by certain dates. This evidence is limited — we can see that drums and horns existed, but not how they were played or what music sounded like.

**Material Remains [E] to [P]:** Actual instruments occasionally survive archaeologically. More often, instrument types can be inferred from materials known to have been available and worked. Iron bells, for example, are archaeologically attested across wide areas, confirming their antiquity.

**Linguistic Evidence [P]:** The distribution of words for instruments and musical terms across related languages can indicate the antiquity of practices. If all Bantu-speaking peoples have related words for a drum type, that drum type likely predates the Bantu expansion and is thus very old.

**Written Sources [E] to [P]:** Arabic and later European sources occasionally describe performances. These accounts are invaluable but fragmentary. Ibn Battuta's descriptions of Mali court music (c. 1352) are among the most detailed for any period.

### Confidence Assessment

Throughout this document:
- **[E] Established:** Confirmed by multiple source types (rare for musical specifics)
- **[P] Probable:** Supported by at least two types of evidence or strong inference
- **[S] Speculative:** Based primarily on backward projection from later ethnographic evidence
- **[T] Traditional/Oral:** Derives from oral tradition about musical practices

## Musical Instruments

### Drums (Membranophones)

Drums were the foundational instruments across Sub-Saharan Africa, serving functions far beyond simple rhythm. They communicated messages across distances, announced royal presence, regulated ceremonial action, and in some traditions were themselves sacred objects embodying spiritual power. [P]

**Talking Drums (*dundun*, *tama*, *kalangu*):**
In West Africa, hourglass-shaped drums with leather cords connecting the two heads allowed players to alter pitch by squeezing the cords, producing tonal variations that could mimic speech. [P] Tonal languages (where pitch distinguishes meaning) made this possible: a skilled drummer could "speak" in the local language, transmitting proverbs, praise names, and messages. Ibn Battuta describes drummers at the Mali court (c. 1352) playing instruments he found impressive, though he does not describe the "talking" function. [E]

These drums were played with a curved stick and held under one arm. Master drummers underwent years of training, learning not only rhythm but the verbal repertoire that the drums articulated. The institution of the talking drum likely predates our period, as the social functions it served (royal communication, praise performance) are documented for early states. [S]

**Kettledrums (*naqqara*, *tabala*):**
Large kettledrums, often played in pairs, served as royal instruments across the Sahel empires. Arabic sources use the term *naqqara* (from which "naker" in medieval Europe), and these drums appear to have reached West Africa through trans-Saharan contacts. [P] They were prominently featured in royal processions and announced the ruler's presence. Al-Umari describes kettledrums among the instruments played before Mansa Musa. [E]

In Ethiopia, large drums (*negarit*) served similar royal functions, with the royal drum representing sovereignty itself — capturing an enemy's negarit was a symbol of conquest. [P]

**Slit Drums:**
Hollowed wooden drums struck with sticks were used across forested regions. Unlike membrane drums, these produced pitch through the resonance of the wooden body. They served communication functions over long distances in forest environments where visibility was limited. [S]

**Goblet Drums (*djembe*):**
The djembe, now perhaps the most internationally recognized African drum, is a goblet-shaped drum carved from a single piece of wood with a goatskin head. Its origins are associated with the Mandinka blacksmith caste (numu), and tradition links it to the Mali Empire period. [T] Whether the djembe existed in its current form during Sundiata's era cannot be confirmed, but goblet-shaped drums are ancient in West Africa, and the djembe's association with the Mande heartland suggests antiquity. [S]

The djembe was traditionally played by nyamakala (members of craft and artisan lineages), particularly the blacksmith and griot castes. Its playing was associated with specific social occasions rather than casual entertainment. [T]

**Frame Drums:**
Circular drums with a single head stretched over a wooden frame were used across the Sahel and Ethiopian regions. In Ethiopian Christian contexts, the *kebero* (a double-headed drum) became essential to liturgical music. [P]

### Stringed Instruments (Chordophones)

**Kora:**
The kora is a 21-string harp-lute with a large calabash resonator covered in cowhide, a long hardwood neck, and strings arranged in two parallel rows. It produces a cascading, harp-like sound and is capable of great melodic and rhythmic complexity. [P]

The kora is strongly associated with the djeli (griot) tradition of the Mande peoples, and oral tradition connects it to the Mali Empire. Whether the kora in its current form existed during Sundiata's time is uncertain [D]; some scholars date its development to a later period. However, harp-lutes of various types are documented in the Sahel region from Arabic sources, and the kora may represent the evolution of earlier instruments. [S]

Kora players (korafola) formed a subset of the djeli profession, and mastery required years of apprenticeship. The instrument accompanied the performance of historical epics, including the Sundiata epic.

**Ngoni (Xalam, Kontingo):**
The ngoni is a small plucked lute with a wooden body, skin soundboard, and typically 3-5 strings. It is older and more widespread than the kora and almost certainly existed during the Mali Empire period. [P] Arabic sources describe lute-type instruments in West Africa, and the ngoni's distribution across Mande-speaking areas suggests antiquity.

The ngoni has been proposed as an ancestor of the American banjo, carried across the Atlantic by enslaved Africans (outside our period but indicative of the instrument's importance).

**Musical Bow:**
The musical bow — a hunting bow used as a musical instrument, with the string plucked or struck while the resonator (often a gourd or the player's mouth) amplifies the sound — is one of the oldest instrument types in Africa and almost certainly predates our period by millennia. [P] Variants include the uhadi and umrhubhe of Southern Africa and related instruments across the continent.

In the Zimbabwe Plateau region, the musical bow was a fundamental instrument, likely played during the period of Great Zimbabwe's florescence. [S]

**Begena:**
The begena is a large Ethiopian lyre with ten strings, traditionally associated with King David and used for contemplative, meditative music rather than festive occasions. [P] Ethiopian tradition claims great antiquity for the instrument, and lyres are depicted in Aksumite art. The begena was played in a restrained style, its deep tones suited to prayer and reflection.

**Krar:**
The krar is a smaller Ethiopian lyre with five or six strings, used for secular music and more festive occasions than the begena. Lyres of this type are documented in the region from Aksumite times. [P]

**Masenqo:**
The masenqo is a single-stringed bowed lute used in Ethiopian secular music, particularly by wandering musicians (azmari). Its antiquity is uncertain; bowed instruments may have reached Ethiopia through contacts with the Arab world. [S]

### Wind Instruments (Aerophones)

**Horns and Trumpets:**
Side-blown horns made from animal horns (elephant, buffalo, antelope) or wood served ceremonial and military functions across Sub-Saharan Africa. [P] Royal processions featured horn ensembles; armies used horns for signaling; and certain occasions required specific horn calls.

In the Swahili Coast cities, the *siwa* (a side-blown horn, often of ivory) was a royal symbol. Ibn Battuta describes horn players at the court of Mogadishu. [E]

Ethiopian traditions include the *malakat*, long metal trumpets played in pairs or ensembles for royal and religious ceremonies. [P]

In the forest kingdoms of West Africa (Benin, Yoruba states), ivory horns were prestige instruments associated with royal authority. Benin bronzes depict horn players, confirming their importance in the period. [E]

**Flutes:**
End-blown and transverse flutes made from bamboo, reed, or wood were widespread. They accompanied herding, provided solo entertainment, and in some contexts served ritual functions. [S] Ethiopian traditions include the *washint*, an end-blown flute used in secular music. [P]

**Panpipes:**
Ensembles of panpipes (multiple tubes of graduated length bound together) are documented in Southern African traditions, where they were played in interlocking patterns with multiple performers. Whether this practice extended to Great Zimbabwe's period is uncertain but plausible. [S]

### Percussion Instruments (Idiophones)

**Balafon (Bala):**
The balafon is a wooden xylophone with gourd resonators, played with rubber-headed mallets. It produces a rich, warm tone and can perform both melody and rhythm. [P]

Oral tradition strongly associates the balafon with Sundiata and the founding of Mali. Bala Faseke, Sundiata's griot, is traditionally credited with either creating or acquiring the bala, and the Kouyate lineage of griots claims custodianship of the original instrument. [T] While the legendary account cannot be verified, the balafon's deep association with Mande culture and its widespread distribution suggest antiquity. Arabic sources describe xylophones in West Africa, confirming their presence by the Mali period. [P]

**Mbira/Thumb Piano:**
The mbira (also kalimba, sanza, likembe, and many other names) consists of metal or wooden tines mounted on a wooden board or resonator, plucked with the thumbs. It is one of the most widespread African instruments, found from West Africa to the Zimbabwe Plateau. [P]

In the Zimbabwe Plateau region, the mbira dzavadzimu (mbira of the ancestors) is deeply integrated with religious practice, used to communicate with ancestral spirits. The instrument type is old, with metal tines documented archaeologically, suggesting the mbira existed during Great Zimbabwe's period. [P]

**Iron Bells:**
Double iron bells (struck with a stick) served as timeline instruments in ensemble music, providing the rhythmic foundation over which drums and other instruments elaborated. Archaeological finds confirm the antiquity of iron bells in West and Central Africa. [E]

In Benin and Yoruba areas, iron bells (agogo) were essential to ceremonial music. [P]

**Rattles and Shakers:**
Gourd rattles filled with seeds or beads, basket rattles, and body-worn rattles (ankle bells, waist rattles) were ubiquitous across the continent. [P] They provided rhythmic accompaniment in ensembles and marked bodily movement in dance.

**Sistrum (*tsenatsil*):**
In Ethiopian Christian worship, the sistrum — a metal frame with loose rings that produce a jingling sound when shaken — was essential to liturgical music. The instrument has ancient Near Eastern origins and reached Ethiopia through Christian influences. [E] Its use is documented from the medieval period onward.

## Regional Traditions

### West African Traditions

#### The Griot/Djeli Tradition

The djeli (griot) institution represents one of the most sophisticated systems of professional musicianship in world history. [P] The djeli were hereditary specialists — members of the nyamakala (occupational caste) system — who served as historians, genealogists, diplomats, musicians, and praise-singers. Their role combined functions that Western categories separate: they were archivists, entertainers, political advisors, and ritual specialists simultaneously.

**Social Position:**
Djeli belonged to a distinct social category, separate from the horon (freeborn nobility) and the jon (enslaved). Their status was complex: they were in some ways subordinate (forbidden to marry outside their caste, socially set apart) yet wielded considerable influence through their control of oral knowledge. A djeli could say things to a king that no one else could — praise that elevated, but also criticism veiled in art. [P]

The relationship between a patron (noble family, king) and their djeli was hereditary: specific djeli lineages served specific noble lineages across generations. The Kouyate djeli, for instance, served the Keita rulers; the Diabate djeli served other lineages. These bonds were considered permanent and sacred. [T]

**Musical Functions:**
Djeli performed multiple musical roles:

- **Praise singing (*fasa*):** Formal praise poetry recounting the deeds of patrons and their ancestors. Praise motivated generosity; lavish gifts were expected in response to effective praise.
- **Historical recitation:** Performance of epics (the Sundiata epic, the Dausi, other regional traditions) that preserved collective memory. These performances could last hours or days.
- **Genealogical recitation:** Formal recitation of lineages, essential at ceremonies (naming, marriage, installation) where ancestry mattered.
- **Entertainment:** Music for social occasions — weddings, festivals, celebrations.
- **Diplomacy:** Djeli served as intermediaries between parties in conflict, using their protected status and verbal skill.

**Instruments:**
Djeli played the kora, ngoni, balafon, and various drums, though instrument specialization varied by region and lineage. The human voice, however, was the primary instrument: the ability to compose and deliver praise poetry was the djeli's essential skill.

**Training:**
Djeli training was intensive and began in childhood. Young djeli learned repertoire, genealogies, instrumental technique, and the aesthetic conventions of their tradition through apprenticeship within their lineage. Full mastery required decades; the greatest djeli were old, having accumulated knowledge through lifetimes of performance. [T]

**The Sundiata Epic:**
The Sundiata epic exemplifies djeli performance. This foundational narrative of the Mali Empire — recounting Sundiata's rise from disabled exile to conqueror — has been performed by djeli for nearly eight centuries. Different djeli lineages perform different versions, with variations in episodes, emphasis, and detail, but the core narrative remains recognizable.

The epic was performed on appropriate occasions (royal ceremonies, festivals, events in the patron lineage's life) with the djeli accompanying himself on kora or ngoni, alternating between sung passages, recitative narration, and instrumental interludes. The performance was interactive: audience members might interject praise for the performer, respond to cues, or offer gifts. A full performance could extend over multiple nights. [T]

#### Court Music in the Mali and Songhai Empires

Arabic sources provide glimpses of court music in the Sahel empires, though the descriptions are frustratingly brief.

**Ibn Battuta's Observations (Mali, c. 1352):**
Ibn Battuta witnessed court ceremonies under Mansa Sulayman and describes musicians among the royal entourage. He mentions:
- Drummers playing before the king
- Singers performing praise songs
- The complex protocol of court performance (who performed when, what gestures were required)

Ibn Battuta was not particularly interested in music, and his descriptions lack technical detail. What emerges is a picture of formal, hierarchical performance where music marked royal presence and structured court ritual. [E]

**Al-Umari's Descriptions (Mali court, based on interviews c. 1330s-1340s):**
Al-Umari's informants described musical instruments at the Mali court, including drums and what appear to be xylophones. The accounts emphasize the grandeur of royal ceremony but again lack musical specificity. [E]

**Songhai Court Music:**
The Tarikh chronicles of Timbuktu mention musicians and performances at the Songhai court, though details are sparse. The askias maintained court traditions inherited from the Mali Empire, including formal praise performance. [P]

**Royal Drum Ensembles:**
Both Mali and Songhai emperors maintained royal drum corps whose instruments symbolized sovereignty. The sounds of the royal drums announced the ruler's movements and were forbidden to unauthorized performers. [P]

#### Forest Kingdom Traditions (Benin, Yoruba)

The forest kingdoms of present-day Nigeria developed distinct musical traditions suited to their social and religious systems.

**Benin Court Music:**
The Oba of Benin maintained elaborate musical establishments. Benin bronzes depict musicians with drums, bells, horns, and other instruments, confirming the importance of music at court. [E]

Specific guilds of musicians served the Oba, their positions hereditary. Music accompanied all major royal ceremonies: coronation, festivals, the reception of dignitaries, and funerary rites. Ivory horns (side-blown) were royal prerogatives, their sound marking the Oba's presence. [P]

The bronze plaques also depict drummers in ceremonial contexts, showing that drum ensembles were central to Benin court life. [E]

**Yoruba Traditions:**
Yoruba musical practice was deeply integrated with religious life. The orisha (deities) each had associated rhythms, songs, and dances: music was a primary medium for communicating with the divine. [S projected from later evidence]

Dundun (talking drum) ensembles were central to Yoruba ceremonial life. Master drummers could reproduce the tonal patterns of Yoruba speech with remarkable precision, "drumming" proverbs, praise names, and ritual formulae. Whether this practice existed in our period cannot be confirmed, but the Yoruba language's tonal nature and the antiquity of drum-speech associations in the region make it probable. [S]

The bata drums, associated with the worship of Shango (the orisha of thunder), represent a specific religious application of drumming tradition. [S]

### Ethiopian Traditions

Ethiopian music represents a unique case within our scope: it is the one African tradition for which we have substantial historical documentation of musical practice, thanks to the Ethiopian Orthodox Church's liturgical records.

#### St. Yared and the Liturgical Music Tradition

Ethiopian tradition credits St. Yared (6th century CE) with creating the distinctive Ethiopian system of liturgical music. [T] According to hagiographic accounts, Yared received divine inspiration to compose sacred chants and develop a musical notation system. While the legendary account cannot be verified historically, Yared is recognized as the founder of Ethiopian church music, and his name is attached to the tradition.

**The Modal System:**
Ethiopian sacred music employs three principal modes:
- **Ge'ez:** The fundamental mode, used for ordinary occasions
- **Izil:** A more restrained mode for penitential seasons
- **Araray:** A more elaborate mode for festive occasions

These modes govern melodic construction, creating distinct sonic characters appropriate to liturgical context. [P]

**Notation:**
Ethiopian church music developed a notational system using symbols written above the Ge'ez text. This notation — which indicates melodic contour, rhythm, and ornament — is one of the few indigenous African musical notations and predates European staff notation. The system, however, serves more as a mnemonic aid for those who already know the music than as a self-sufficient score. [P]

**Instruments in Worship:**
Ethiopian liturgical music employs distinctive instruments:
- **Kebero:** Double-headed drums of various sizes, struck with the hands
- **Tsenatsil:** Sistra (metal rattles) shaken rhythmically
- **Mekwamiya:** Prayer staffs tapped on the ground to mark rhythm

The combination of voices, drums, sistra, and the rhythmic tap of prayer staffs creates a sound world unlike any other Christian tradition. [E]

**Liturgical Dance:**
Distinctive among Christian traditions, Ethiopian Orthodox worship includes liturgical dance. Clergy and debtera (religious specialists) perform stylized movements during services, swaying, stepping, and moving in coordinated patterns. This practice is documented from the medieval period. [P]

#### Secular Music

Ethiopian secular music existed alongside the church tradition but is less well documented for our period.

**Azmari Tradition:**
The azmari were wandering musicians who performed secular songs, often with topical or satirical content. They played the masenqo (bowed lute) and sang songs that could praise or criticize patrons — a function somewhat analogous to the West African griot, though the azmari had lower social status. The antiquity of the azmari tradition is uncertain; the practice is documented in later centuries but may extend back into our period. [S]

**Court Music:**
The Ethiopian royal court maintained musicians, though our information is limited. Royal occasions (coronations, victories, feasts) would have featured musical performance, likely including both secular and religious elements. The royal drums (negarit) announced the sovereign's presence and symbolized royal authority. [P]

**The Begena:**
The begena (large lyre) was associated with contemplative, spiritual music — tradition links it to King David's harp. Unlike the livelier krar, the begena was played in a meditative style appropriate to prayer and reflection. Its use in our period is probable given the instrument's ancient associations. [P]

### Swahili Coast Traditions

Swahili Coast music reflects the region's position at the intersection of African, Arab, and eventually Indian Ocean influences. Unfortunately, evidence for our period is limited.

**Islamic Influence:**
The adoption of Islam by Swahili elites introduced Quranic recitation, Arabic devotional music, and eventually Sufi musical practices to the coast. The call to prayer (adhan) became part of the urban soundscape. [P]

However, indigenous African musical elements persisted. The Swahili were culturally syncretic: they integrated Arab/Islamic and Bantu African elements into a distinctive coastal culture. Music almost certainly reflected this synthesis. [S]

**Taarab Precursors:**
Taarab, the Swahili Coast's most celebrated musical form, emerged in the nineteenth century, well after our period. However, the musical elements from which taarab developed — Arab melodic influences, African rhythmic patterns, poetic performance — were present earlier. The synthesis that became taarab was centuries in preparation. [S]

**Ceremonial Music:**
Ibn Battuta describes music at the court of Mogadishu (1331) and notes the presence of horns and drums. Unfortunately, his description is brief. We can infer that Swahili rulers, like rulers elsewhere, used music to mark authority and ceremonial occasion. [E]

**Ngoma:**
The term ngoma (from a Bantu root meaning "drum") refers across East Africa to drum-centered music and dance traditions. Ngoma traditions almost certainly existed on the Swahili Coast, representing the indigenous Bantu musical substrate onto which Arab influences were layered. [S]

### Southern African Traditions

The music of the Zimbabwe Plateau during Great Zimbabwe's florescence (~11th-15th centuries) must be largely inferred from later ethnographic evidence and limited archaeological finds.

#### Mbira Traditions

The mbira (thumb piano) is deeply embedded in Shona culture, where it serves religious functions as well as entertainment.

**Mbira Dzavadzimu:**
The mbira dzavadzimu ("mbira of the ancestors") is used in bira ceremonies to facilitate communication with ancestral spirits. The instrument's music induces a meditative state and can lead to spirit possession. [S based on later evidence]

Whether this specific practice existed during Great Zimbabwe's period is uncertain, but the mbira's antiquity is supported by archaeological finds of metal tines and the instrument's widespread distribution. The religious function — communicating with ancestors — is consistent with what we know of Shona religious practice. [P]

**Performance Context:**
Mbira was traditionally played at night, in ceremonies that could last until dawn. A medium (often a woman) might become possessed by an ancestral spirit who would then speak through hereriods to advise the living. The mbira's music created the appropriate spiritual environment. [S]

#### Musical Bow

The musical bow was a fundamental instrument in Southern Africa, likely preceding the mbira. Its use in the Great Zimbabwe region is probable given the instrument's antiquity and distribution. [P]

The bow was often played by women and could accompany singing or provide solo entertainment. Its soft sound suited intimate settings rather than large ceremonies. [S]

#### Drum Traditions

Drums were used in the Zimbabwe Plateau region for royal ceremonies, communication, and religious occasions. The Shona term ngoma refers to drum-centered traditions similar to those elsewhere in East Africa. [S]

Royal drums symbolized authority — the sound of the king's drums announced his presence and proclaimed his sovereignty. This pattern is consistent with broader African traditions of royal drumming. [P]

---

## Dance Traditions

Dance in Sub-Saharan Africa was not separate from music but inseparable from it: the concept of "music" in most African cultures encompasses the integration of sound, movement, and often text. Dance was ubiquitous, serving social, religious, political, and recreational functions.

### Royal and Court Dances

Courts across Sub-Saharan Africa maintained dance traditions that marked royal occasions and demonstrated royal power.

**Mali/Songhai:**
Ibn Battuta describes formal performance at the Mali court that included movement as well as music. Royal occasions featured elaborate choreography with designated performers. The djeli performed for the ruler; the ruler himself might perform certain symbolic gestures. [E]

**Benin:**
Benin bronzes depict figures in dynamic poses that suggest dance, often in ceremonial contexts. The Oba's court maintained dance traditions integral to royal ceremony. [E from iconography]

**Ethiopia:**
Ethiopian royal ceremonial included processions and movements that constituted a form of court dance, though separate from the liturgical dance tradition of the church. Victory celebrations, coronations, and major festivals featured coordinated movement. [P]

**Great Zimbabwe:**
The scale of Great Zimbabwe's enclosures suggests they accommodated large ceremonial gatherings that likely included dance. The nature of these ceremonies is unknown, but dance was almost certainly integral. [S]

### Ritual and Religious Dances

**Masquerade Dance (West Africa):**
In the forest kingdoms, masked dancers embodied spirits in ritual performance. The dancer, wearing an elaborately carved mask and costume, became (for the duration of the performance) the spirit represented. These traditions are documented ethnographically for later periods; their antiquity is probable given the age of masquerade traditions in the region. [S]

Masquerade served multiple functions: initiation rites, funerals, agricultural ceremonies, and the enforcement of social norms (masquerade societies sometimes served as judicial bodies). The performance was simultaneously entertainment, religious practice, and social regulation. [S]

**Ethiopian Liturgical Dance:**
As noted above, the Ethiopian Orthodox Church incorporated dance into worship. The choreography was formalized, with specific movements for specific occasions, performed by clergy and debtera. This practice is documented from the medieval period. [P]

**Bira Ceremonies (Zimbabwe Plateau):**
In bira ceremonies, dance accompanied mbira music in rituals of spirit possession. The medium's movements as she became possessed constituted a form of sacred dance, while participants might dance in support. [S based on later evidence]

**Orisha Worship (Yoruba):**
Each orisha had associated dance movements performed during worship. These dances were not generic but specific: the movements for Shango differed from those for Oshun, expressing each deity's character. The antiquity of this practice is uncertain but probable given the age of orisha worship. [S]

### Social and Celebratory Dances

**Life-Cycle Celebrations:**
Births, initiations, weddings, and funerals were marked by dance across Sub-Saharan Africa. These events gathered communities and affirmed social bonds; dance was the primary medium of collective celebration.

**Harvest and Agricultural Celebrations:**
The agricultural cycle provided occasions for dance. Harvest festivals, planting ceremonies, and rain-making rituals incorporated dance as a means of thanksgiving, petition, or celebration. [S]

**Work Dances:**
Labor was often rhythmicized: pounding grain, hoeing fields, and other repetitive tasks were accompanied by songs and movements that made work communal and less tedious. These functional dances were not performance for audiences but integrated into daily life. [S]

## Masquerade and Masked Performance

Masquerade — performance by masked dancers embodying spirits or characters — was a major art form in forest West Africa during our period. The masks themselves survive archaeologically and in museum collections; the performances must be reconstructed.

### The Nature of Masquerade

**Spiritual Embodiment:**
In most masquerade traditions, the masked dancer was not merely representing a spirit but embodying it. The dancer's identity was subsumed; what remained was the spirit made manifest. Audience members were expected to treat the masquerade as the spirit itself, not as a person in costume. [P]

This meant masquerade was spiritually dangerous. Proper preparation (initiation, ritual purification, adherence to taboos) was essential. The masks themselves held power and required careful handling. [S]

**Secrecy and Initiation:**
Masquerade traditions were often controlled by secret societies whose members had undergone initiation. The knowledge of which person danced which masquerade, how masks were made, and the rituals of performance was restricted. Women and uninitiated men were typically excluded from this knowledge (though women had their own secret societies and masquerade traditions in some cultures). [P]

### Regional Masquerade Traditions

**Yoruba Egungun:**
The Egungun masquerades represented ancestral spirits returning to interact with the living. Elaborately costumed performers appeared at funerals and annual festivals, embodying the collective dead. The practice is documented ethnographically; its antiquity during our period is probable. [S]

**Benin and Edo Traditions:**
Benin bronze plaques depict figures that appear to be masqueraders, confirming the presence of masquerade at the Benin court. Royal masquerades served political as well as spiritual functions, demonstrating the Oba's command of supernatural power. [E from iconography]

**Bamana/Mande Masquerades:**
Mande societies maintained complex masquerade traditions controlled by initiation societies (ton). The masks represented diverse characters: spirits, animals, moral types. Some masquerades were entertaining; others were terrifying; some enforced social norms. [S]

### The Mask as Art Object

The carved wooden masks of West Africa represent major achievements in world art. They range from highly naturalistic to extremely abstract, each tradition having its own aesthetic conventions.

Masks were created by specialist carvers, often members of the blacksmith caste (numu) in Mande societies. The creation of a mask was itself a ritual process requiring spiritual as well as technical knowledge. [P]

The masks that survive in collections today, while mostly from later periods, likely represent traditions extending back into our period. Mask forms show considerable continuity over time. [S]

## Court Performance and Royal Praise

### The Function of Praise

Praise — the formal celebration of a patron's virtues and deeds — was a central function of African court performance. Praise was not flattery; it was a serious art form with political and spiritual dimensions.

**Social Function:**
Effective praise honored the recipient and, in doing so, affirmed social relationships. The praised ruler demonstrated generosity by rewarding the praiser; the praiser's artistry honored the ruler's magnificence. The exchange was reciprocal, creating and reinforcing bonds. [P]

**Historical Function:**
Praise often included genealogical and historical content — the deeds of ancestors, the battles won, the kingdoms conquered. In this way, praise performance preserved and transmitted historical memory. The djeli praising Sundiata's descendants recounted Sundiata's victories; each performance reinforced collective memory. [T]

**Spiritual Function:**
In some traditions, praise had spiritual efficacy. Speaking the names and deeds of ancestors invoked their presence; proper praise brought blessing. Conversely, the withdrawal of praise could indicate disapproval with serious consequences. [S]

### State Occasions

Major state occasions across Sub-Saharan kingdoms featured musical performance as essential components.

**Coronation and Installation:**
The installation of a new ruler required musical accompaniment: drums announced the succession, praise-singers celebrated the new sovereign, and specific ceremonial music marked the transition of power. [P]

**Reception of Ambassadors:**
Diplomatic occasions featured display, including musical display. Ibn Battuta's descriptions of court reception in Mali, Mogadishu, and other African courts consistently note the presence of musicians. [E]

**Military Triumph:**
Victorious rulers celebrated with music: drums, praise-singers celebrating the victory, perhaps the captured instruments of defeated enemies. The return from campaign was an occasion for musical celebration. [P]

**Religious Festivals:**
Court participation in religious festivals (Islamic celebrations in Sahel courts, Christian festivals in Ethiopia) included musical components appropriate to each tradition. [P]

### The Power of the Drum

Across Sub-Saharan Africa, royal drums were symbols of sovereignty, not merely instruments.

**Mali/Songhai:**
The royal drums accompanied the Mansa or Askia on all public occasions. Their sound announced the ruler's presence and demanded recognition. [P]

**Ethiopia:**
The negarit (royal drum) represented Ethiopian sovereignty. Capturing an enemy's negarit was a symbol of conquest; the drums' sounding proclaimed the emperor's authority. [P]

**Kongo:**
The ManiKongo maintained royal drums that were sacred objects as well as instruments. Their traditions are documented from Portuguese contact (1480s onward) but likely extend earlier. [P]

**Great Zimbabwe:**
Royal drums almost certainly marked the authority of Great Zimbabwe's rulers, though specific evidence is lacking. The pattern is too consistent across Africa to suppose its absence in this major kingdom. [S]

## For Fiction Writing

### Scene-Setting: Performance Contexts

**A Djeli Performance at the Mali Court:**

The scene unfolds in the royal compound — perhaps a shaded courtyard with the Mansa seated on a dais, counselors and nobles arranged in order of rank. The djeli enters, kora in hand (or ngoni, or perhaps accompanied by drummers). He begins with a formal greeting, praising the Mansa and his lineage.

*Sensory details:*
- The cascade of kora notes, complex polyrhythms against a melodic line
- The djeli's voice, trained to carry across distances, rising and falling with the tonal patterns of Mande speech
- The audience's responses: murmurs of appreciation, exclamations at particularly fine phrases
- The rhythm of calabash rattles if other performers accompany
- The heat of the afternoon, the shade of cloth awnings, the bright colors of robes against the earth-brown of walls
- The Mansa's gestures of approval, the movement of servants bringing gifts for the praiser

*Social dynamics:*
- The tension of praise: will the Mansa reward generously? Will the djeli's praise satisfy?
- The political content: genealogy establishes legitimacy; references to past deeds imply expectations for present behavior
- The presence of potential rivals and their djeli, listening, judging
- The historical weight: this performance connects to centuries of similar performances, invoking ancestors who were praised in the same formulas

**An Ethiopian Church Service:**

The scene is a rock-hewn church at dawn (or a built church, depending on region and period). Priests in white robes, the *qeddest* curtained, the *tabot* concealed within.

*Sensory details:*
- The low hum of Ge'ez chanting, unfamiliar scales, microtonal melismas
- The persistent shimmer of sistra (*tsenatsil*) — metal on metal, dozens shaking together
- The deep pulse of drums (*kebero*), different sizes producing different pitches
- The tap of prayer staffs (*mekwamiya*) on stone floor
- Incense — frankincense, pervasive, almost overwhelming
- Candlelight flickering on painted walls; the colors of saints and angels
- The movement of clergy: swaying, stepping, a slow liturgical dance
- The congregation standing (no pews), men on one side, women on the other
- The cool of stone underfoot, shoes left at the entrance
- Dawn light beginning to penetrate narrow windows

*Emotional texture:*
- The sense of antiquity: these chants claiming descent from St. Yared, from the sixth century
- The physical rigor: services lasting hours, fasting bodies, the effort of standing
- The cumulative effect of repetition: phrases returning, drum patterns cycling, the trance-like accumulation
- The moment of the *tabot*'s procession: the heart of the service, when the representation of the Ark moves

**A Masquerade Appearance:**

The scene is a village clearing, perhaps at night (masquerades often appeared at night), torches or firelight providing illumination. The community has gathered; the masquerade emerges.

*Sensory details:*
- Drums: the rhythm intensifying as the masquerade approaches
- The rustle and swish of the costume: raffia, cloth, sometimes animal skins
- The mask: carved wood, perhaps painted, representing a spirit with non-human features
- The dancer's movement: not human movement but the movement of the spirit, stylized, powerful
- The crowd's response: awe, fear, excitement; children held back; adults making way
- The voice: if the masquerade speaks, the voice is altered, muffled by the mask, not the voice of the dancer but the voice of the spirit
- Dust rising from stamping feet
- The smell of smoke, of sweat, of the costume's materials
- The feeling of presence: something has entered the village that is not entirely human

*Social dynamics:*
- The knowledge gap: initiates know who is dancing, what preparations were made; others do not
- Women's exclusion: in many traditions, women must avert their eyes or leave; their presence is complicated
- The message: masquerades often communicate — praise, warning, instruction
- The danger: masquerades can be aggressive, unpredictable; the spirit's behavior is not the dancer's
- The ending: the masquerade's departure, the return to ordinary life

### Instruments and Their Sounds

**Kora:**
A cascading, harp-like sound, but with a distinctive attack from plucked strings. The notes run in rapid sequences; skilled players produce polyphonic textures where bass patterns interweave with melodic lines. The sound is sweet but complex. In a quiet space, the kora's soft tones carry; in noise, it may be lost. The calabash resonator adds a hollow, wooden quality.

**Djembe:**
Three basic sounds: bass (struck in center, deep and resonant), tone (struck toward edge, clear and ringing), slap (sharp, cracking, produced with a specific hand technique). A master djembefola moves between these sounds in rapid succession, creating rhythms of astonishing complexity. The drum is loud — meant to be heard outdoors, across distances.

**Talking Drum (Dundun):**
The pitch bends as the player squeezes the cords connecting the drumheads. The effect is speech-like: rising, falling, wavering tones that approximate the tonal patterns of language. Someone who knows the drum language hears words; someone who does not hears rhythmic tonal phrases.

**Mbira:**
Soft, intimate, percussive tones — the metal tines plucked by thumbs produce notes that overlap and blur together. Often played inside a resonating gourd that amplifies and adds a buzzing quality. The sound is hypnotic, layered, suitable for long sessions of repetitive, trance-inducing music. Not loud — a night-time, indoor sound.

**Balafon:**
Warm, wooden, xylophone-like tones, but with the resonance of gourd chambers beneath each key. Louder than the mbira, suitable for ensembles and outdoor performance. The sound has a mellow quality distinct from the sharper tone of metal xylophones.

**Ethiopian Drums and Sistra:**
The drums produce regular pulses at multiple pitches. The sistra create a constant shimmer of metallic sound — rhythmic but continuous, without the discrete attacks of struck drums. Together with chanting voices, the effect is enveloping, immersive.

### Dialogue and Performance Speech

**Praise Formulas:**
Djeli performance uses elaborate praise formulas, often invoking genealogy:

- "Son of [Father], son of [Grandfather], son of [Great-grandfather]..." — the genealogical chain establishing lineage
- "The lion of [Place]" — animal epithets indicating strength, nobility
- "He who [deed]" — praise names recalling specific accomplishments
- Proverbs: "The great tree's shade shelters many" — praising generosity

**Griot's Address to Audience:**
The djeli might address the audience directly:

- "Listen, children of the Mande..." — invoking collective identity
- "I speak what my father spoke, and his father before him..." — establishing traditional authority
- "This is no lie, for djeli do not lie..." — asserting truthfulness (a formulaic claim)

**Call and Response:**
Much African music involves call and response: a leader sings or plays a phrase, and the group responds. This creates opportunities for dialogue-like patterns in performance:

- Leader: "Who is the greatest?" Response: "[Name]!" (or a formulaic response)
- The congregation responding to liturgical phrases in Ethiopian worship
- Work songs where one person leads and others respond while laboring

### Dance Descriptions

**Describing African Dance for Non-African Readers:**
Emphasize:
- **Polyrhythm in the body:** Different body parts moving to different rhythmic patterns simultaneously — feet in one rhythm, hips in another, shoulders in a third
- **Groundedness:** African dance typically keeps the center of gravity low, with bent knees and connection to the earth (contrasting with ballet's upward orientation)
- **Isolation:** The ability to move one body part while keeping others still
- **Response to drums:** The dance responds to specific drum patterns; a change in rhythm produces a change in movement
- **Community:** Dancers relate to each other, to musicians, to audience; the boundary between performer and spectator is permeable

**Specific Movements:**
- Feet stamping rhythms into the ground
- Hips swaying or circling in complex patterns
- Shoulders shaking or isolating
- Head movements, often subtle tilts and turns
- Arms gesturing, sometimes carrying objects (staffs, cloths, rattles)
- Facial expression: sometimes ecstatic, sometimes masked (literally or figuratively)

### The Sound World

**Creating an Acoustic Setting:**
The sound of an African scene is never silent. Consider:

- **Background:** Birds (especially at dawn and dusk), insects (especially at night), livestock, human activity
- **Spatial sound:** Drums carrying across distances, the call to prayer from minarets, church bells (Ethiopia), village soundscapes
- **Work sounds:** Grain being pounded (rhythmic thuds), weaving (the clack of the loom), blacksmithing (hammer on anvil)
- **Voice:** Conversation in tonal languages where pitch matters, the cadences of greetings, the sounds of the marketplace
- **Music:** Not confined to formal occasions but woven through daily life — work songs, children's songs, casual instrument playing

## Scholarly Debates

| Question | Position A | Position B | Assessment |
|----------|------------|------------|------------|
| **Antiquity of the kora** | The kora existed in its current form during the Mali Empire period, as oral tradition claims | The kora in its current form is a later development (perhaps 18th century); earlier periods had simpler harp-lutes | [D] Debated; the kora's ancestors certainly existed, but the 21-string form's age is uncertain |
| **St. Yared and Ethiopian notation** | Yared historically developed Ethiopian chant and its notation in the 6th century | The Yared tradition is legendary; Ethiopian music developed more gradually | [T/P] Yared's historical existence is uncertain, but a tradition of that age probably exists |
| **Continuity of musical traditions** | African musical traditions show remarkable continuity; modern practices reflect ancient ones | Musical traditions evolve significantly; backward projection is unreliable | [D] Both positions have merit; continuity varies by tradition and context |
| **The djeli caste's origins** | The djeli caste originated in the founding period of Mali or earlier | The nyamakala system (including djeli) developed gradually over centuries | [D] Origins unclear; the system was established by the Mali period but may have earlier roots |
| **African music as "functional"** | African music serves social functions rather than existing as autonomous art | This framing underestimates African aesthetic consciousness and composers' artistry | [D] Both functional and aesthetic dimensions exist; early ethnomusicology overemphasized function |
