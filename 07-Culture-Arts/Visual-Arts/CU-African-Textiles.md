## Overview

Textiles in Sub-Saharan Africa were far more than utilitarian objects. They constituted a primary form of wealth, a medium of artistic expression, a marker of social identity, and a currency of exchange. From the narrow-strip weavings of the Sahel to the raffia cloths of the Kongo basin, from the indigo-dyed fabrics of Hausaland to the cotton shamma cloths of Ethiopia, African textile traditions represented sophisticated technologies developed over millennia and integrated into every aspect of social, economic, and political life. To understand African kingdoms is to understand cloth — how it was made, who made it, how it was used, and what it meant.

The textile arts of Sub-Saharan Africa challenge simplistic narratives about African material culture. Long before European contact, African weavers had developed complex technologies capable of producing fabrics that rivaled those of any civilization. The narrow-strip loom of West Africa — a technological innovation indigenous to the continent — enabled the production of textiles of remarkable complexity and beauty. Dyers, particularly in the indigo traditions of Hausaland and Yorubaland, developed chemical processes that produced colorfast fabrics traded across the Sahara. These were not "primitive" crafts but sophisticated industries that supported urban populations and generated wealth on which empires were built.

The sources for African textile history present characteristic challenges. Cloth rarely survives archaeologically in tropical climates; our knowledge depends heavily on written accounts (primarily Arabic and Portuguese), artistic representations (particularly in Benin bronzes and Ethiopian manuscript illuminations), and the continuity of living traditions that can be cautiously projected backward. The evidence is sufficient to establish the broad outlines of textile production and trade, but many details — precise techniques, specific patterns, the full social meanings — remain uncertain or must be inferred from later ethnographic observation.

## Materials

### Cotton: Africa's Indigenous Fiber

Cotton (*Gossypium* species) was the most important textile fiber in Sub-Saharan Africa. Crucially, African cotton cultivation did not depend on introduction from outside; Africa possessed its own indigenous cotton species that were domesticated independently.

**Gossypium herbaceum** (Levant cotton or African cotton) grew wild across the Sahel and was cultivated across West Africa and into the Ethiopian highlands. Archaeological evidence from sites including Djenne-Jeno in the inland Niger Delta demonstrates cotton cultivation and textile production from at least the early first millennium CE. [P] The cotton-growing zone roughly corresponded to the Sahel and savanna regions where rainfall was sufficient but not excessive — cotton requires a distinct dry season for harvesting.

**Regional cultivation patterns:**

- **West African Sahel (Mali, Songhai):** Cotton was extensively cultivated in the middle Niger region. The Djenne-Jeno excavations revealed spindle whorls and cotton fabric fragments dating to the first millennium CE, indicating substantial textile production predating Arabic written records. [E]

- **Hausaland:** The Hausa city-states (Kano, Katsina, Zazzau) were major cotton-producing regions by the late medieval period. The *Kano Chronicle* tradition credits Muhammad Rumfa (r. 1463-1499) with encouraging cotton weaving, though production almost certainly predated his reign. [P]

- **Ethiopia:** The Ethiopian highlands cultivated cotton for domestic textile production. The high plateaus provided suitable conditions, and cotton weaving was established by the Aksumite period at latest. [P]

**Cotton processing:** The transformation of raw cotton into thread required multiple labor-intensive steps:

1. **Harvesting:** Cotton bolls picked by hand when mature
2. **Ginning:** Removal of seeds from fiber, typically using a wooden roller
3. **Carding/bowing:** Separation and fluffing of fibers using a bow-like instrument or combs
4. **Spinning:** Conversion of fiber into thread using a drop spindle (the spinning wheel was not indigenous to Africa)

Spinning was predominantly women's work across most of Sub-Saharan Africa, while weaving was more often (though not universally) men's work. This gendered division of labor appears consistent across multiple regions and is well-attested in later ethnographic accounts. [P]

### Silk

Silk occupied a complex position in African textile traditions — valued as a luxury import but also produced locally in some regions.

**Imported silk:** Silk from China and Persia reached Africa through trans-Saharan and Indian Ocean trade networks. Silk threads were highly prized in West Africa, where they were incorporated into indigenous weavings. The kente tradition of the Akan peoples, which achieved its greatest elaboration in later centuries, combined locally spun cotton with imported silk threads. Arabic sources note silk among the luxury goods traded across the Sahara. [E]

**Wild silk:** The Sahel region possessed indigenous silk-producing insects, including varieties of wild silkworm. Local production of wild silk is attested in the Mande cultural area, where it was woven into prestigious fabrics. The so-called "Bondoukou" silk tradition, while best documented from later periods, may have medieval antecedents. [S]

**Ethiopian silk:** Ethiopia, with its long-standing connections to the Red Sea trade, had access to imported silk. Silk threads were incorporated into high-status garments, and the Ethiopian elite favored silk-embellished clothing for ceremonial occasions. [P]

### Raffia

Raffia fiber, derived from the leaves of raffia palms (*Raphia* species), was the dominant textile material in the equatorial forest regions where cotton cultivation was impractical due to excessive humidity.

**The Kongo raffia tradition:** The Kingdom of Kongo developed a sophisticated raffia textile industry that produced fabrics renowned across Central Africa and, after European contact, exported to Europe. Raffia palm leaves were stripped, dried, and separated into fibers that could be woven into cloth of remarkable fineness. Portuguese observers in the late fifteenth and sixteenth centuries compared Kongo raffia cloth to European velvet and satin — probably exaggerated praise, but indicating genuine quality. [P]

**Processing:** Raffia fiber preparation involved:
1. Harvesting young palm fronds
2. Stripping the leaf tissue from the midrib
3. Drying and separating the fibers
4. Softening through pounding or soaking

Raffia cloth production was particularly associated with the Kongo basin peoples, including the BaKongo, BaTeke, and BaKuba (the latter famous for elaborate cut-pile "velvet" cloths, though this tradition reached its greatest development after our period). [P]

### Barkcloth

Barkcloth — fabric made from the beaten inner bark of certain trees, particularly fig species (*Ficus*) — represented an older textile technology that predated weaving in some regions. While often dismissed as "primitive," barkcloth production required considerable skill and could produce supple, durable fabric.

**Production:** Barkcloth making involved:
1. Harvesting strips of inner bark from suitable trees (without killing the tree)
2. Soaking to soften the fibers
3. Extended beating with wooden mallets to felt and expand the fibers
4. Drying and sometimes oiling or treating the finished cloth

Barkcloth traditions were particularly important in the Great Lakes region of East Africa (Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi) and persisted alongside woven textiles well into the historical period. Archaeological evidence from Uganda suggests barkcloth production extending back several centuries. [P]

### Wool

Wool played a limited role in Sub-Saharan African textiles, primarily in regions where sheep husbandry was significant.

**Ethiopian wool:** Sheep herding in the Ethiopian highlands provided wool for weaving. Woolen textiles supplemented cotton production, particularly for garments suited to the cool highland climate. [P]

**Saharan fringe:** The pastoral peoples of the Saharan fringe (Tuareg, Fulani) raised sheep and used wool, though their nomadic lifestyle limited fixed-loom weaving. Woolen textiles from North Africa also entered Sub-Saharan markets through trans-Saharan trade. [P]

## Weaving Technologies

### The Narrow-Strip Loom

The narrow-strip loom was the characteristic weaving technology of West Africa and one of the most distinctive technical innovations of the continent. This apparatus, also called the horizontal double-heddle loom, produced narrow strips of cloth (typically 5-15 centimeters wide) that were subsequently sewn together edge-to-edge to create larger textiles.

**Construction and operation:**

The narrow-strip loom consisted of:
- **Warp beam:** A weighted or staked roller holding the warp threads, placed at a distance from the weaver
- **Heddles:** Two (or more) sets of heddles attached to foot pedals, allowing the weaver to raise alternate sets of warp threads
- **Shuttle:** A bobbin or stick carrying the weft thread, passed through the shed (the opening created by raised warp threads)
- **Beater:** A wooden sword or reed used to pack the weft tight
- **Breast beam:** A roller at the weaver's end where finished cloth accumulated

The weaver sat at ground level, using foot pedals to operate the heddles while passing the shuttle by hand and beating in the weft. As cloth accumulated on the breast beam, the weaver could release more warp from the distant warp beam, allowing continuous weaving of strips many meters long.

**Why narrow strips?**

The narrow-strip technique, while requiring additional labor to sew strips together, offered several advantages:

1. **Portability:** The loom components were relatively light and could be set up anywhere with sufficient space (often outdoors in village settings)
2. **Efficiency:** A single weaver could produce cloth rapidly once the loom was warped
3. **Design flexibility:** Different strips could be woven with different patterns and then arranged creatively in the final assembled cloth
4. **Specialization:** Individual weavers could specialize in particular strip patterns, with assembly handled separately

The narrow-strip technique is definitively attested by Ibn Battuta's description of Mali in the 1350s, and its distribution across West Africa — from Senegambia to northern Nigeria — suggests considerable antiquity. [E]

**Gender and production:**

Across most of West Africa, narrow-strip weaving was men's work. This gendered association was strong enough to be noted by external observers and is consistent across diverse ethnic groups. Women typically dominated spinning (thread production), while men dominated weaving (cloth production). The reasons for this division are debated; possible factors include the semi-public nature of outdoor weaving, the association of particular technologies with male craft guilds, and longstanding cultural patterns. [P]

### The Broad Loom

The broad loom (vertical or upright loom) produced cloth in wider pieces, eliminating the need to sew strips together. This technology was characteristic of the Ethiopian highlands and parts of East Africa, and was probably introduced from the Mediterranean/Middle Eastern world via Red Sea trade connections.

**Construction:**

The broad loom typically featured:
- A vertical or near-vertical frame
- Warp threads stretched between upper and lower beams
- Heddles operated by hand or foot
- A shed created by inserting a sword or batten

The weaver worked standing or seated before the frame, passing the weft through the shed and beating it up. Finished cloth could be as wide as the loom frame permitted — typically 60-100 centimeters or more.

**Ethiopian tradition:**

Ethiopian weaving employed the broad loom to produce cotton cloth of considerable sophistication. The *shamma* (a large rectangular cloth worn as a wrap or toga) and the *gabi* (a heavier blanket-like garment) were standard products. Ethiopian weavers incorporated decorative borders (*tibeb*), typically in colored threads, that marked status and regional identity. [P]

**Swahili Coast:**

The Swahili Coast presents a complex picture. Local cotton weaving existed, but the coastal cities were also major importers of textiles from India, China, and the Islamic world. The relative balance between local production and imports is difficult to assess for the medieval period. [S]

### Ground Looms and Other Technologies

Various simpler weaving technologies coexisted with the elaborate loom systems:

**Ground looms:** A basic frame staked to the ground, with warp threads stretched between two beams. The weaver worked from a sitting or kneeling position. This technology was widespread and could produce cloth of considerable quality despite its apparent simplicity. [P]

**Raffia weaving (Kongo):** Raffia cloth was typically woven on a simple vertical loom. The Kongo tradition produced both plain cloth and elaborately patterned fabrics using a variety of techniques including supplementary weft, twill weaves, and (in later periods) cut-pile "velvet." [P]

**Mat weaving:** While technically distinct from textile weaving, mat production using reeds, grasses, and palm leaves was widespread and provided everyday household items. The techniques overlapped with raffia weaving in some traditions. [P]

## West African Textile Traditions

### Kente and the Akan Strip-Weaving Tradition

The kente cloth of the Akan peoples (including the Asante/Ashanti and Ewe of modern Ghana and Togo) represents the most celebrated African textile tradition, though its greatest elaboration occurred after our period (post-1600). The foundations of this tradition, however, were laid during the medieval period.

**Origins [D]:**

The origins of kente weaving are debated and deeply intertwined with Akan origin traditions. According to oral accounts, weaving was introduced to the Akan through contact with neighboring peoples or through divine inspiration. Archaeological evidence is limited, but narrow-strip weaving was certainly established in the broader West African region by the medieval period. The specific development of the Akan tradition — with its distinctive aesthetic and technical characteristics — probably dates to the centuries immediately preceding or following 1500. [S]

**Technical characteristics:**

- **Narrow strips:** Kente is woven in strips typically 10-15 centimeters wide, then sewn together
- **Warp-faced weave:** The warp threads dominate the visible surface, creating a characteristic sheen
- **Complex patterns:** Geometric designs created through deliberate arrangement of colored warp threads and supplementary weft elements
- **Silk and cotton combination:** High-status kente incorporated imported silk threads with local cotton

**Patterns and meanings:**

Kente patterns carried names and associations — particular designs might commemorate historical events, reference proverbs, or indicate the wearer's status or occasion. While the full symbolic vocabulary is best documented from later periods, the principle of meaningful patterns almost certainly characterized medieval production as well. [S]

**Production context:**

Kente weaving was royal and elite craft. Weavers worked under royal patronage, and the finest cloths were reserved for royalty and nobility. The Asante kingdom (which rose to prominence in the late seventeenth century) systematized royal control over the most prestigious patterns, but such associations between textiles and political authority certainly predated the Asante state. [P]

### Narrow-Strip Weaving in the Sahel (Mali and Songhai)

The empires of Mali and Songhai were major centers of textile production, and cotton cloth was both a domestic necessity and a significant trade commodity.

**Evidence from Arabic sources:**

Ibn Battuta, visiting Mali in 1352-1353, provides the most detailed medieval account of Sahelian textiles. He describes:

- Cotton cloth as widespread clothing material
- Robes (*jilbab*) worn by the elite
- Distinctions in dress marking social status
- The production of cloth as an established industry [E]

Al-Umari's description of Mali under Mansa Musa (based on Egyptian informants' accounts from the 1320s) notes the wealth displayed in clothing and the sophistication of Malian dress, though with less technical detail than Ibn Battuta. [E]

**Production centers:**

The middle Niger region — particularly the area around Djenne, Timbuktu, and the inland delta — was a major textile production zone. The combination of cotton cultivation in the surrounding agricultural areas, established weaving traditions, and urban markets created conditions for substantial cloth production. Archaeological evidence from Djenne-Jeno, including spindle whorls and fabric fragments, confirms textile production in this region from the first millennium CE. [E]

**Trade functions:**

Cloth served multiple economic functions in the Sahelian empires:

1. **Domestic clothing:** The basic need driving most production
2. **Tribute:** Conquered peoples paid tribute partly in cloth
3. **Currency:** Standardized cloth pieces functioned as a medium of exchange
4. **Long-distance trade:** Cloth was both exported (across the Sahara and to forest regions) and imported (North African and later European textiles)

**Technical characteristics:**

The Sahelian narrow-strip tradition shared the basic technology with other West African regions but developed distinctive aesthetic conventions. Simpler cloths featured plain weaves in natural cotton colors (white, cream, brown depending on cotton variety). Higher-status cloths incorporated dyed threads (particularly indigo blue), supplementary weft patterns, and geometric designs. [P]

### Indigo Dyeing: The Hausa and Yoruba Traditions

Indigo dyeing represents one of the great technical and artistic achievements of African textile production. The Hausa city-states and Yoruba kingdoms developed indigo traditions of exceptional sophistication, producing colorfast blue and blue-black fabrics that were valued across the Sahara and beyond.

**The chemistry of indigo:**

Indigo dyeing is technically demanding. The indigo molecule (*indigotin*) is not water-soluble in its colored form; it must be chemically reduced (using alkaline conditions and fermenting organic matter) to a soluble, colorless state (*leuco-indigo*), applied to the fabric, and then oxidized back to its colored form through exposure to air. This process requires:

- Preparation of indigo dye from plant material (primarily *Indigofera tinctoria* and related species)
- Construction and maintenance of dye vats with proper chemical conditions
- Knowledge of fermentation processes and timing
- Multiple dipping and oxidation cycles to achieve deep colors

The Hausa and Yoruba dyers developed this chemistry empirically over generations, creating industrial processes that could produce large quantities of high-quality dyed cloth. [P]

**Hausa indigo production:**

The Hausa city-states, particularly Kano, became synonymous with indigo-dyed cloth. The famous Kano cloth (*riga*, a voluminous gown; *dan ciki*, a dyed undergarment) was traded across the Sahara and was known in North Africa and beyond.

**Key features of Hausa indigo tradition:**

- **Dye pits:** Large, permanent vat installations, often grouped in dyeing quarters of cities. Some Kano dye pits remained in continuous use for centuries.
- **Guild organization:** Dyers organized into professional groups with transmitted knowledge
- **Resist techniques:** Patterns created by tying, stitching, or waxing cloth before dyeing to resist the dye in selected areas
- **Beating:** Finished indigo cloth was beaten with wooden mallets to produce a distinctive sheen (the indigo was burnished into the fabric surface)

The chronology of Hausa indigo production is uncertain. The tradition was clearly well-established by the sixteenth century; its origins may extend considerably earlier. [S]

**Yoruba indigo production:**

Yoruba weavers and dyers produced *adire* — indigo-resist-dyed cloth — using techniques including:

- **Adire eleko:** Starch resist (cassava paste applied to create patterns)
- **Adire oniko:** Tie-dyeing (cloth tied in patterns before dyeing)
- **Adire alabere:** Stitch-resist (patterns created by stitching and gathering cloth)

While *adire* as a named tradition is documented primarily from later periods, the underlying techniques of indigo resist-dyeing were almost certainly practiced during our period. Yoruba towns were significant textile production centers, and the famous Yoruba women's wrapper (*iro*) was a major product. [S]

**Trade in indigo cloth:**

Indigo-dyed cloth was a significant export commodity:

- **Trans-Saharan trade:** Hausa blue cloth reached North Africa, where it was valued for its quality and colorfastness
- **Regional trade:** Indigo cloth was traded throughout West Africa
- **Currency function:** In some contexts, standardized pieces of indigo cloth served as currency

The Arabic geographer Leo Africanus, writing in the early sixteenth century (slightly after our primary period), describes the cloth trade of Kano in considerable detail, indicating a well-established and substantial industry. [E]

### Benin Textiles

The Kingdom of Benin, though best known for its bronze-casting tradition, was also a significant textile producer. Evidence for Benin textiles comes primarily from:

1. **Depictions in Benin bronzes:** The bronze plaques and heads show elaborate textile patterns on the clothing of depicted figures
2. **Portuguese accounts:** Early European observers noted the quality of Benin cloth production
3. **Archaeological fragments:** Limited textile remains from archaeological contexts

**Characteristics [P]:**

- **Elaborate wrapper cloths:** The bronzes depict figures wearing patterned wrappers with geometric designs
- **Status distinctions:** Different patterns and materials marked different ranks and occasions
- **Coral and cloth:** High-status Benin dress combined textiles with coral beadwork, with the coral being perhaps more prestigious

**Production context:**

Benin weavers worked within the guild system that characterized Benin craft production more broadly. Specific guilds held monopolies on certain products, with production organized under royal oversight. [P]

## Kongo Raffia Cloth

### Production System

The Kingdom of Kongo developed the most sophisticated raffia textile tradition in Sub-Saharan Africa. Raffia cloth served as currency, tribute, trade goods, and status markers throughout the Kongo cultural sphere.

**Raw material preparation:**

Raffia palms (*Raphia* species) grew abundantly in the Kongo basin. Young fronds were harvested, the leaf material stripped from the midrib, dried, and then separated into individual fibers. The finest cloths used only the thinnest, most pliable fibers, sorted by quality during preparation. [P]

**Weaving:**

Raffia was woven on simple vertical looms. The finished cloth dimensions were determined by the loom size and the length of individual raffia fibers (which limited continuous warp length). Standard cloth pieces were typically 30-50 centimeters square or rectangular, with multiple pieces sewn together for larger items. [P]

**Decoration:**

Kongo raffia cloth employed multiple decorative techniques:

- **Woven patterns:** Geometric designs created through manipulation of warp and weft
- **Embroidery:** Designs stitched onto finished cloth
- **Applique:** Pieces of cloth sewn onto a base fabric
- **Cut-pile (later development):** A technique where extra weft threads were cut to create a "velvet" surface; while the famous Kuba cut-pile cloths postdate our period, simpler versions may have medieval antecedents

**Quality gradations:**

Kongo raffia cloth ranged from coarse utility fabric to extremely fine prestige cloth. The finest examples, described by Portuguese observers as comparable to European silk or velvet, were reserved for royalty and high nobility. [P]

### Trade Value and Currency Function

Raffia cloth was a fundamental unit of value in the Kongo economic system. It functioned as:

**Currency:** Standardized cloth pieces served as money. Prices were quoted in cloth units (*mbongo* or *libongo*), and cloth was accepted for virtually any transaction. This textile currency system was well-established before European contact. [E]

**Tribute:** Subject populations paid tribute to the Kongo king partly in cloth. The royal storehouses accumulated vast quantities of textiles, representing both wealth and political claims. [P]

**Trade goods:** Cloth was traded widely within Central Africa and, after European contact, became an export commodity. Portuguese traders eagerly acquired Kongo cloth for sale elsewhere in Africa. [E]

**The Portuguese evidence:**

Portuguese accounts from the late fifteenth and sixteenth centuries provide detailed observations of Kongo textiles:

> "The men of this country make cloths of palm leaf fiber, which they call *infula*, and they are so well made that they could be velvet, satin, and taffeta, but they are finer and softer." — Duarte Lopes/Filippo Pigafetta, *Description of the Kingdom of Congo* (1591), describing earlier observations [P]

This description, while potentially exaggerated, indicates that Portuguese observers were impressed by Kongo textile quality.

### Social Meanings

Cloth in Kongo society carried profound social meanings:

**Status markers:** Different cloth qualities, patterns, and quantities of dress marked social rank. The king and high nobles wore the finest cloths; commoners wore simpler fabrics or barkcloth.

**Gender associations:** Raffia weaving was primarily men's work in Kongo society, while women were responsible for agricultural production. This division shaped household economics and gender relations.

**Ritual use:** Cloth was essential for life-cycle rituals (birth, initiation, marriage, death) and for interactions with the spiritual world. The dead were wrapped in cloth for burial; spirits received cloth offerings; sacred objects were covered in textiles.

**Political symbolism:** Gifts of cloth from the king signified favor and created political obligations. The accumulation and distribution of cloth was central to Kongo political economy.

## Ethiopian Textile Traditions

### Cotton Weaving

Ethiopia possessed a sophisticated cotton weaving tradition documented from the Aksumite period onward. The Ethiopian highlands, with suitable climate for cotton cultivation and a literate, urbanized society, developed textile production integrated into both domestic economy and international trade.

**Technology:**

Ethiopian weavers used the broad loom (vertical or upright frame loom), probably introduced from the Mediterranean/Red Sea world. This technology produced cloth in wider pieces than the West African narrow-strip method. [P]

**Products:**

The primary Ethiopian textile products included:

**Shamma:** A large (approximately 3 x 1.5 meters) white cotton cloth worn as a wrap or toga. The shamma was the standard garment for both men and women, draped over the body in various configurations. Quality ranged from plain, coarse everyday wear to fine cloth with elaborate decorated borders for special occasions. [E]

**Gabi:** A heavier blanket-like garment, often with a fuzzy surface created by brushing, used for warmth in the cool highland climate. [P]

**Netela:** A lighter shawl or head covering, often with decorative borders. [P]

**Decorative borders (tibeb):**

The distinctive feature of Ethiopian textiles was the *tibeb* — a woven decorative border, typically at the ends of the cloth. Tibeb incorporated:

- Colored threads (red, yellow, green, black)
- Geometric patterns
- Regional variations indicating origin or style
- Status markers (more elaborate tibeb for higher status)

The tibeb tradition continued throughout our period and remains characteristic of Ethiopian textiles today. Its antiquity is attested by representations in medieval Ethiopian manuscript illuminations. [P]

### Social Organization of Weaving

Ethiopian weaving was associated with particular ethnic or occupational groups. In much of highland Ethiopia, weavers occupied a marginal social position — considered skilled craftsmen but not fully integrated into the dominant agricultural society. This occupational specialization, while best documented from later periods, probably characterized medieval Ethiopian textile production as well. [S]

**Gender roles:** Unlike West Africa, Ethiopian weaving was primarily men's work. Spinning (thread preparation) was women's work, consistent with the broader African pattern. [P]

**Urban and royal production:** Ethiopian towns supported professional weavers who produced for urban markets and royal courts. The Ethiopian emperors maintained court weavers who produced textiles for royal use and diplomatic gifts. [P]

### Textiles in Ethiopian Culture

**Religious significance:** Textiles played important roles in Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity:

- **Liturgical cloths:** Churches used specially woven cloths for altar coverings, priestly vestments, and other ritual purposes
- **Manuscript wrappings:** Precious manuscripts were wrapped in cloth for protection
- **Processional items:** Religious processions featured elaborately draped participants and textile banners

**Status display:** Elite Ethiopians displayed status through textile quality and quantity. The emperor and nobility wore fine shammas with elaborate tibeb; commoners wore plainer cloth.

**Trade:** Ethiopian textiles were not major export commodities (unlike gold or ivory), but they entered regional trade networks. Ethiopian cloth was known and traded in the Red Sea region and beyond. [P]

## Swahili Coast Textiles

### The Import Trade

The Swahili Coast cities — Kilwa, Mombasa, Lamu, Zanzibar, Mogadishu, and others — were major textile importers. Indian Ocean trade brought fabrics from:

**India:** Indian cotton textiles, particularly from Gujarat and the Coromandel coast, were the most significant imports. Indian cloth was prized for its quality, patterns, and colorfastness. [E]

**China:** Chinese silk occasionally reached the Swahili Coast, though in smaller quantities than Indian cotton. [P]

**The Islamic world:** Textiles from Persia, Yemen, and Egypt entered Swahili markets. [P]

**Evidence from archaeological finds:**

Excavations at Swahili Coast sites have recovered textile fragments, including:
- Cotton cloth, both local and imported
- Silk fragments
- Evidence for trade in raw cotton and finished goods

The preponderance of imported textiles in archaeological contexts suggests that the Swahili elite favored foreign cloth, though this may partly reflect preservation biases. [D]

### Local Production

Despite the prominence of imports, local textile production existed on the Swahili Coast:

**Cotton cultivation:** Cotton was grown in the East African coastal hinterland and in some coastal areas. Local farmers supplied raw cotton to both local weavers and export trade. [P]

**Local weaving:** Swahili weavers produced cloth for domestic consumption. The extent and quality of this production relative to imports is debated. Some scholars argue that local production was substantial but archaeologically invisible; others suggest imports dominated the market. [D]

**Barkcloth and other materials:** In the interior regions that supplied the Swahili Coast, barkcloth and other non-woven textiles supplemented woven cloth. [P]

### Textiles in Swahili Society

**Elite consumption:** The Swahili elite demonstrated their wealth and cosmopolitan connections through dress. Fine imported textiles — Indian cottons, Chinese silks — marked elite status. The display of foreign luxury goods was central to Swahili political culture. [P]

**Trade goods:** Textiles were a crucial component of Swahili commercial networks. Swahili merchants:
- Imported textiles for domestic consumption
- Re-exported imported textiles to the African interior
- Used cloth as currency in interior trade

**Social stratification:** Textile quality marked social distinctions between the *waungwana* (freeborn Swahili elite) and others. Dress codes, while not rigidly enforced, communicated social position. [P]

## Textiles in Trade

### Cloth as Currency

Across much of Sub-Saharan Africa, cloth functioned as currency — a standardized medium of exchange accepted for goods and services.

**The Kongo system:** Kongo raffia cloth currency has been discussed above. The *lubongo* (cloth unit) was the fundamental denomination of the Kongo monetary system, with prices quoted and debts recorded in cloth terms. [E]

**West African cloth currency:** In the Sahel and forest zones, cotton cloth pieces served currency functions:
- Standardized cloth strips of fixed dimensions circulated as money
- Prices were quoted in cloth units
- Tribute payments included specified cloth quantities
- Cloth was accumulated as stored wealth

**Distinctions from coinage:** Cloth currency differed from metal coinage in several respects:
- Cloth was directly useful (as clothing material)
- Cloth deteriorated over time (unlike metal)
- Cloth was more bulky and harder to transport in large quantities
- Cloth was locally produced (unlike gold or copper, which had specific sources)

These characteristics shaped how cloth currency functioned in practice.

### Textile Trade Routes

**Trans-Saharan trade:**

Textiles moved in both directions across the Sahara:

*Northward (from Sub-Saharan Africa):*
- Hausa indigo cloth was exported to North Africa, where it found ready markets
- Other West African textiles reached Mediterranean ports

*Southward (into Sub-Saharan Africa):*
- North African woolens, particularly from the Maghreb
- European cloth (increasing after 1400)
- Egyptian and Middle Eastern textiles

**Indian Ocean trade:**

The Swahili Coast was a major textile import zone:
- Indian cottons dominated the market
- Textiles were a primary commodity imported from Asia
- Coastal merchants re-exported imported cloth to the interior

**Regional trade within Africa:**

Textiles circulated through internal African trade networks:
- Sahelian cloth reached forest regions where cotton did not grow
- Forest zone products (kola, gold) were exchanged for Sahelian cloth
- Specialized production centers supplied broad regional markets

### Luxury Imports

**Silk:**

Silk was the ultimate textile luxury, imported from:
- China (via trans-Asian and Indian Ocean routes)
- Persia
- Byzantine/Mediterranean sources

Silk threads were incorporated into indigenous weavings (particularly in the kente tradition), while whole silk garments marked the highest elite status.

**North African and European cloth:**

After c. 1400, European textiles began entering Sub-Saharan African markets:
- Portuguese traders brought cloth for exchange
- European woolens, linens, and later printed cottons entered trade

This import competition would eventually transform African textile markets, but within our period (to 1600), local production remained dominant. [P]

## Social Meanings of Textiles

### Status and Hierarchy

Textiles were primary markers of social status across Sub-Saharan Africa:

**Quantity:** Elite individuals owned and displayed more cloth than commoners. Royal courts accumulated vast textile stores.

**Quality:** Fine weaving, elaborate patterns, and expensive materials (silk, the finest cotton) marked high status. Coarse cloth or non-woven materials (barkcloth) indicated lower status.

**Colors:** Certain colors carried associations. White was often associated with purity, spirituality, and sometimes mourning. Indigo blue marked wealth (since quality dyeing required skill and resources). Red and gold often indicated royalty or high nobility.

**Patterns:** Specific patterns were reserved for or associated with particular statuses. This is best documented for the kente tradition, where certain designs were royal prerogatives, but similar associations probably existed across multiple textile traditions.

### Gender and Textiles

The gendered division of textile labor shaped social relations:

**Women's work:** Across most of Sub-Saharan Africa, spinning (cotton preparation) was women's work. This labor-intensive task occupied significant female time and was often performed communally.

**Men's work:** Weaving was predominantly (though not universally) men's work in West Africa and the Kongo. The narrow-strip loom was typically operated by male weavers.

**Exceptions:** In some regions, women wove, particularly using simpler technologies. Ethiopian weaving was men's work. The gendered associations varied by region and technology.

**Cloth and marriage:** Textiles were central to marriage transactions in many societies. Bridewealth payments included cloth; marriage marked a woman's transition from daughter to wife in part through changes in dress.

### Ritual and Ceremonial Uses

**Life-cycle rituals:** Textiles marked every major life transition:
- **Birth:** Infants were wrapped in specific cloths; naming ceremonies involved textile gifts
- **Initiation:** Coming-of-age ceremonies included acquisition of adult dress
- **Marriage:** Weddings featured elaborate textile exchange and display
- **Death:** The dead were wrapped in cloth for burial; funeral ceremonies involved textile distribution

**Religious use:**
- **Offerings:** Cloth was offered to deities, ancestors, and spirits
- **Ritual objects:** Sacred objects were wrapped, covered, or dressed in textiles
- **Priestly dress:** Religious specialists wore distinctive garments
- **Church textiles:** In Christian Ethiopia, liturgical cloths served ritual functions

**Political ceremonies:**
- **Coronation:** Royal investiture included ceremonial robing
- **Tribute:** Subject peoples presented cloth as tribute; rulers distributed cloth as patronage
- **Diplomacy:** Textile gifts accompanied diplomatic missions

### Identity and Community

**Ethnic markers:** Different peoples developed distinctive textile styles that served as ethnic markers. Dress communicated group identity and could instantly identify a stranger's origin.

**Regional styles:** Within broader traditions, regional variations distinguished local identities. Patterns, colors, and techniques marked geographical origin.

**Innovation and change:** While traditions were conservative, textile styles evolved over time. New patterns, techniques, and materials were incorporated; styles changed in response to trade contacts, political changes, and aesthetic innovation.

## Scholarly Debates

| Question | Position A | Position B | Current Consensus |
|----------|------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Antiquity of narrow-strip weaving** | Developed independently in West Africa before trans-Saharan contact | Introduced or influenced by North African/Mediterranean contact | Most scholars favor indigenous development, with possible early trans-Saharan contact influence [D] |
| **Gender division of textile labor** | Reflects universal or ancient patterns | Result of specific historical developments (trade, Islam, state formation) | Debated; probably combines long-standing patterns with historical changes [D] |
| **Quality of African textiles relative to imports** | African textiles were competitive with imports throughout the period | Imports were generally superior, driving local decline | Evidence suggests African textiles were competitive until the industrial revolution [P] |
| **Extent of Swahili local production** | Substantial local industry supplemented imports | Imports dominated; local production was marginal | Debated; archaeology suggests significant imports but cannot rule out substantial local production [D] |
| **Origin of kente tradition** | Medieval or earlier development | Post-1600 elaboration of earlier simpler traditions | The full kente tradition as documented is largely post-1600; earlier antecedents uncertain [D] |

## For Fiction Writing

### Weavers at Work

**The narrow-strip weaver's scene:**

A West African weaver at work offers rich sensory material:

*Setting:* The weaver works outdoors, in the shade of a tree or a simple shelter. The loom stretches several meters from a staked warp beam to the seated weaver. Other weavers may work nearby; weaving is often semi-communal.

*Sounds:* The rhythmic *thwack* of the beater pushing weft tight; the *click* of foot pedals operating heddles; the soft *whir* of the shuttle passing through the shed; conversation and sometimes singing among working weavers.

*Sight:* The long warp threads catching sunlight; the gradual accumulation of finished cloth on the breast beam; the weaver's hands in constant motion — pedals, shuttle, beater, pedals; the colors of dyed threads creating patterns that emerge slowly from the loom.

*Smell:* The scent of cotton (slightly dusty, faintly sweet); the weaver's own sweat in warm weather; cooking fires from nearby compounds.

*Physical sensation:* The weaver's position is demanding — seated on the ground, legs extended to the pedals, back curved over the work. Long hours produce aches; skilled weavers develop particular muscle definition in their arms and shoulders.

*Duration:* A skilled weaver can produce a strip several meters long in a day of steady work. Complex patterns slow production; simple cloth is faster. The final assembly of strips into a finished cloth is separate work.

**The indigo dyer's scene:**

Indigo dyeing offers dramatic visual and olfactory possibilities:

*Setting:* The dye pits — large earthenware vats sunk into the ground in a dedicated compound. The pits may be ancient, in continuous use for generations. The surrounding ground is stained blue from years of splattered dye.

*Smell:* The fermentation vats have a powerful, distinctive odor — ammoniacal, organic, almost foul to the unaccustomed nose. Experienced dyers barely notice; visitors may gag. This smell permeates the dyers' quarter of the city.

*Sight:* The vat contents appear greenish-yellow (the reduced leuco-indigo) until cloth is withdrawn and exposed to air. Then, as oxidation proceeds, the cloth transforms before the viewer's eyes from yellow-green to blue to deep blue-black. This "magical" color change is a moment of wonder.

*Sound:* The splash of cloth entering vats; the drip of excess dye; the slap of beaten cloth; the conversation of dyers at work.

*Physical process:* Cloth is dipped, withdrawn, exposed to air, and dipped again — multiple cycles to build up color depth. The dyer's hands and arms are permanently stained blue.

**The raffia weaver's scene (Kongo):**

*Setting:* A vertical loom set up in or near a dwelling. The loom is simpler than the West African narrow-strip apparatus — a frame with warp threads stretched vertically.

*Materials:* The raffia fibers — cream to pale tan in color, with a distinctive sheen and texture unlike cotton. The finest fibers are thin and flexible; coarser grades have a slightly rough, papery quality.

*Sound:* The soft rustle of raffia (different from the crisp sound of cotton); the tap of the beater; the weaver's breathing and occasional humming.

*Time:* Raffia weaving produces smaller pieces (limited by fiber length) than continuous cotton strip-weaving. Multiple pieces must be sewn together.

### Cloth Markets

**The scene:**

A market day in a major textile center — Djenne, Kano, Kilwa, or the Kongo capital Mbanza Kongo — offers rich material:

*Visual abundance:* Cloth spread everywhere — draped over stalls, piled in bundles, wrapped around merchants, displayed for inspection. Colors: the deep blues of indigo-dyed goods; the natural creams and browns of undyed cotton; the occasional flash of imported silk; patterned and plain, coarse and fine.

*Sound:* Bargaining in multiple languages; the specific vocabulary of textile commerce; merchants calling their wares; the rustle and snap of cloth being unfolded, displayed, refolded.

*Smell:* The dusty smell of cotton; the distinctive scent of indigo-dyed cloth (carrying traces of the fermentation process); the background odors of the market — food cooking, animals, humanity.

*Touch:* Textile quality is assessed by touch. Buyers rub cloth between fingers, testing fineness, density, and feel. The connoisseur recognizes quality by hand as much as by eye.

*Social dynamics:* The market brings together producers (or their agents), traders, and consumers. Status is displayed through dress; the market is a place to see and be seen. Transactions may be quick or involve extended negotiation. Cloth may be purchased with cowrie shells, gold dust, other cloth, or commodities in barter.

*Currency transactions:* When cloth itself is currency (as in the Kongo), the market involves cloth-for-cloth transactions — higher-quality cloth exchanged for multiple pieces of lower quality, cloth exchanged for other goods at established rates.

### Wearing Textiles

**The draped garment:**

Most African dress in our period involved draping rather than tailoring. The shamma, wrapper, toga-style garments — these were rectangular cloths arranged on the body rather than cut-and-sewn fitted garments.

*Physical experience:* Wearing a wrapper or toga requires constant awareness — the garment must be adjusted, re-draped, and managed. Walking, sitting, working all involve textile management. This shapes posture and movement.

*Social communication:* How a garment is draped can communicate meaning. The angle of a toga, the height of a wrapper, the exposure or coverage of particular body parts — all convey information about status, situation, and intent.

*Weather:* Wrapped garments respond to climate. In heat, they can be loosened for ventilation; in cold, they can be wrapped tight. The Ethiopian gabi provides warmth in cool highlands; the Sahelian cotton wrapper offers comfort in dry heat.

**The act of dressing:**

A scene of putting on elaborate dress — for a ceremony, an audience, a special occasion — offers dramatic possibilities:

*The choice of cloth:* Which garment for this occasion? The finest reserved for the most important moments; everyday cloth for ordinary days.

*Assistance:* Elaborate dressing may require help — servants or family members assisting with draping, adjusting, final arrangement.

*Transformation:* The person emerging in full ceremonial dress is transformed — status made visible, identity proclaimed, social role assumed through the physical act of clothing the body.

### Speech and Dialogue

**Textile vocabulary:**

Textile production generates specialized vocabulary. Characters might use:

- Names of specific cloth types, patterns, weaves
- Quality assessments ("fine thread," "tight weave," "good dye")
- Technical terms for processes and tools
- Idioms relating cloth to life (common in many African languages)

**Weaver's speech:**

A weaver character might:
- Describe work in technical terms
- Express aesthetic judgments about quality
- Speak of cloth in economic terms (value, price, exchange)
- Reference the social meanings of particular cloths

**Market language:**

Textile markets had their own linguistic conventions:
- Standardized terms for pricing and measurement
- Praise-language advertising wares
- Negotiation tactics and conventional exchanges
- Assessments of quality (and disputes about same)
