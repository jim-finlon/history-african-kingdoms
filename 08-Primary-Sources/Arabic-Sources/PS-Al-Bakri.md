## Overview

Abu 'Ubayd al-Bakri's *Kitab al-Masalik wa-l-Mamalik* ("Book of Routes and Realms"), completed around 1068 CE, stands as the single most important written source for the Ghana Empire and one of the foundational texts for the study of medieval West Africa. Writing from Cordoba in al-Andalus (Islamic Spain), al-Bakri compiled a comprehensive geographic encyclopedia that described the known world from Europe to Central Asia, but it is his detailed treatment of Sub-Saharan Africa — particularly the Ghana Empire and the trans-Saharan trade network — that has made his work indispensable to Africanist historians. [E]

Al-Bakri never crossed the Sahara, never saw the gold-adorned courts he describes, never heard the drums summoning subjects to the Ghana king's audience. Yet his account of the Ghana Empire under its last great ruler, [[02-Prosopography/West-Africa/Ghana-Empire/HF-Tunka-Manin|Tunka Manin]], provides the most detailed portrait of any Sub-Saharan African court before the fourteenth century — a portrait that includes the layout of the dual-city capital, the elaborate court ceremonies, the royal funeral customs, the mechanisms of the gold-salt trade, and the religious coexistence between the king's indigenous faith and the thriving Muslim merchant community. This level of detail, combined with al-Bakri's systematic approach and his careful distinction between what he knew from reliable sources and what was mere rumor, gives his work exceptional value. [E]

The significance of al-Bakri's text extends beyond its factual content. His description of Ghana demonstrates that sophisticated, wealthy, administratively complex African states existed centuries before European contact — and that Arab geographers knew of them and engaged with them as equals in the world of medieval commerce. At a time when European knowledge of Sub-Saharan Africa was virtually nonexistent, Arabic scholars like al-Bakri possessed detailed information about African political systems, economic practices, and cultural traditions. His work thus challenges the colonial-era assumption that African civilizations were "discovered" by Europeans, revealing instead a long history of African participation in transcontinental knowledge networks. [E]

## The Author

### Biography

Abu 'Ubayd 'Abd Allah ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz al-Bakri was born around 1014 CE into an aristocratic Arab family in Huelva, in the western part of al-Andalus (Islamic Iberia). The Bakri family traced its lineage to the prestigious Bakr ibn Wa'il tribe of Arabia, and al-Bakri's father, 'Abd al-'Aziz, served as the independent ruler (emir) of the taifa (small kingdom) of Huelva and Saltis, one of the many petty states that emerged after the collapse of the Umayyad Caliphate of Cordoba in 1031. [P]

The political instability of the taifa period shaped al-Bakri's life. When his father's small emirate was absorbed by the more powerful taifa of Seville, the family lost its political position but retained its wealth and social prestige. The young al-Bakri received an excellent education befitting his aristocratic status, studying Arabic literature, poetry, geography, and the religious sciences. He eventually settled in Cordoba, which despite the political fragmentation of al-Andalus remained one of the great intellectual centers of the Islamic world — a city famous for its libraries, scholars, and its position at the crossroads of Mediterranean commerce and knowledge. [P]

Al-Bakri spent most of his adult life in Cordoba as a scholar and man of letters. He was part of the cultivated elite of Andalusian society, moving in circles that valued learning, poetry, and elegant Arabic prose. He was not primarily a geographer but rather a polymath in the classical Arabic tradition — his literary works include a dictionary of place names mentioned in Arabic poetry (*Mu'jam ma Ista'jam*) that demonstrates his mastery of Arabic language and literature. The geographic encyclopedia for which he is now remembered was one work among many, though it proved to be the most enduring. [P]

Al-Bakri died around 1094 CE in Cordoba, having lived through the transformative Almoravid conquest of al-Andalus (which began in 1086). His death came before the full consolidation of Almoravid power, but he witnessed the beginning of a new political era that would reshape both al-Andalus and the African territories his book describes. [P]

### Motivation and Purpose

Al-Bakri's *Kitab al-Masalik wa-l-Mamalik* belongs to a well-established genre of Arabic geographic literature — the *masalik wa-l-mamalik* ("routes and realms") tradition that provided practical information about travel routes, distances, and the political and economic conditions of different regions. These works served multiple audiences: merchants planning trading expeditions, administrators governing far-flung territories, scholars curious about the diversity of the world, and general readers seeking entertainment and edification. [E]

The specific impetus for al-Bakri's work is not recorded, but several factors likely contributed:

**Intellectual Curiosity:** Al-Bakri was a scholar working within a tradition that valued comprehensive knowledge of the world. The compilation of geographic information was an established scholarly enterprise, and al-Bakri's book followed models established by earlier geographers like Ibn Hawqal and al-Istakhri. [P]

**Commercial Relevance:** Cordoba was integrated into trans-Mediterranean trade networks, and Andalusian merchants had commercial interests in North Africa and (indirectly) in the trans-Saharan gold trade. Information about the sources and routes of gold — the commodity that underwrote much of medieval commerce — was economically valuable. [P]

**Political Context:** The Almoravid movement, which had emerged in the western Sahara and was expanding into both Morocco and the Sahel during the very years al-Bakri was writing, made information about the western Sahara and its borderlands politically relevant. Though al-Bakri's text is not propagandistic, his interest in the regions where Almoravid power was expanding may reflect contemporary political concerns. [P]

**Literary Ambition:** The *masalik* genre allowed for display of erudition and prose style. Al-Bakri, a literary figure, may have seen geographic writing as an opportunity to demonstrate his mastery of Arabic scholarship while contributing something useful to the tradition. [P]

### Relationship to Sub-Saharan Africa

**Al-Bakri never visited Africa.** This fact — stated clearly in the text itself and confirmed by all biographical sources — is fundamental to understanding both the strengths and limitations of his account. He compiled his description of West Africa from:

**Earlier Written Sources:** Al-Bakri drew on previous Arabic geographic works, including those of Ibn Hawqal and other *masalik* writers who had described Africa. He synthesized and updated information from this existing literature. [E]

**Contemporary Merchant Reports:** Cordoba's commercial connections to North Africa gave al-Bakri access to merchants who had crossed the Sahara or traded in the Maghrebian cities that served as northern termini for trans-Saharan commerce. These informants provided current information that supplemented and corrected older written accounts. [E]

**Information Networks:** The Islamic world in the eleventh century possessed sophisticated networks for transmitting geographic and commercial knowledge. Scholars, merchants, diplomats, and pilgrims regularly exchanged information across vast distances. Al-Bakri could tap into these networks without leaving Cordoba. [P]

Al-Bakri is generally careful to indicate the quality of his information. He distinguishes between what he knows from written sources, what comes from contemporary reports, and what is uncertain or contested. This methodological self-consciousness makes him a more reliable compiler than many medieval geographers. However, his account remains filtered through multiple layers of transmission — from eyewitness observation to merchant report to al-Bakri's text — with inevitable possibilities for distortion at each stage. [E]

### Cultural Lens

Al-Bakri wrote as a Muslim scholar of Arab aristocratic background, from a position within one of the most sophisticated urban cultures of the medieval world. His cultural framework shaped what he noticed, what he valued, and how he interpreted what he learned about Africa.

**Muslim Perspective:** Al-Bakri evaluated religious practices against Islamic norms. He noted with interest where non-Muslim African rulers tolerated Islam and where they practiced what he regarded as pagan customs. His descriptions of indigenous African religious practices — including the Ghana king's funeral customs involving the burial of servants with the dead — are detailed but carry implicit judgment. That said, al-Bakri is notably less polemical than some Arabic writers; he describes without excessive condemnation, letting the information speak. [P]

**Commercial Interest:** Al-Bakri's information focuses heavily on matters relevant to commerce: trade routes, taxation, currency, and the mechanisms of exchange. This reflects both the likely interests of his informants (merchants) and the practical purposes of the *masalik* genre. Political and military information is present but subordinate to commercial data. [P]

**Urban Civilization Standard:** Coming from Cordoba, one of the great urban centers of the medieval world, al-Bakri implicitly measured African societies against standards of urban sophistication. His evident interest in the Ghana capital's layout, the presence of mosques in the Muslim quarter, and the ceremonial elaboration of the court suggests he was looking for signs of "civilization" as he understood it — and finding them. [P]

**What He Could Not See:** Al-Bakri had no access to internal African perspectives on the events and structures he describes. He knew Ghana from the outside, through the reports of foreign merchants who saw the public face of power — the ceremonies, the trade, the visible wealth. The internal dynamics of Soninke politics, the meanings of indigenous religious practices, the lived experience of ordinary Ghanaians — these were invisible to him. His account tells us what Arab merchants saw and understood, which is valuable but inevitably partial. [P]

## The Text

### Structure and Content

The *Kitab al-Masalik wa-l-Mamalik* is a large geographic encyclopedia organized roughly by region. The work is not exclusively or even primarily about Africa; it covers the entire known world from al-Bakri's Mediterranean perspective. The structure follows the conventions of the *masalik* genre:

**Regional Organization:** The text proceeds region by region, describing the geography, major cities, routes, peoples, rulers, and economic conditions of each area. [E]

**Route Information:** True to its genre, the work provides detailed information about travel routes, including distances between places, travel times, and conditions along the way. This practical information served merchants and administrators. [E]

**Political Description:** Each major region or polity receives treatment of its political organization — who rules, how succession works, what the extent of the ruler's authority is, and how the territory is administered. [E]

**Economic Data:** Trade goods, taxes, currencies, and commercial practices are systematically described. Al-Bakri was particularly interested in valuable commodities like gold and salt. [E]

**Cultural and Religious Notes:** Information about the religious practices, customs, and social organization of different peoples is included, though usually subordinate to geographic and commercial data. [E]

The full text of the *Masalik* has not survived intact in any single manuscript. What we possess are various partial copies and excerpts, some of which were incorporated into later geographic compilations. The African sections are among the best-preserved portions, perhaps because of their commercial importance. [P]

### Sections Relevant to This Project

Al-Bakri's African coverage focuses on the western Sahara and Sahel — the regions connected to the trans-Saharan trade routes that interested Mediterranean merchants. His treatment can be organized as follows:

| Section/Region | Topics | Period | Reliability Assessment |
|----------------|--------|--------|------------------------|
| **The Maghreb** | Morocco, western Algeria; Almoravid origins | Contemporary (c. 1060s) | [E] — close to al-Bakri's own world |
| **Sijilmasa** | Gateway city for trans-Saharan trade; routes south | Contemporary | [E] — well-documented entrepot |
| **The Western Sahara** | Desert routes; oases; the Sanhaja Berbers | Contemporary | [P] — merchant informants reliable on routes |
| **Awdaghust** | Saharan trading town under Almoravid pressure | c. 1054-1068 | [E] — detailed account of recent events |
| **Ghana Empire** | Court, capital, trade, religion, customs | c. 1067-1068 (under Tunka Manin) | [E] for structure; [P] for details |
| **Trans-Saharan Routes** | Salt trade, gold exchange, caravan organization | Contemporary | [E] — merchant information |
| **The "Silent Trade"** | Reported gold-exchange practice | Traditional | [D] — possibly literary convention |
| **Tadmekka and Eastern Routes** | Alternative routes to the Niger | Less detailed | [P] — secondary to western routes |

### The Work's Place in Arabic Geographic Literature

Al-Bakri's *Masalik* represents the high achievement of the Andalusian branch of Arabic geography. His work built on a tradition stretching back to the ninth century and forward through al-Idrisi (1154), Ibn Khaldun (c. 1377), and later compilers. Within this tradition, al-Bakri is distinguished by:

**Systematic Approach:** He gathered information methodically from multiple sources and attempted comprehensive coverage. [E]

**Critical Judgment:** He noted where his sources disagreed and indicated the quality of his information. [E]

**Prose Quality:** As a literary figure, al-Bakri wrote elegant, readable Arabic prose that helped his work circulate. [E]

**Currency:** Writing in the 1060s, his information about Africa was current — he describes the Ghana court as it existed in his own time, not as it had existed generations earlier. [E]

These qualities make al-Bakri's work more valuable than many geographic compilations that simply copied earlier sources without updating or critical assessment.

## African Content

### Ghana Empire: The Heart of Al-Bakri's African Account

Al-Bakri's description of the Ghana Empire is the most extensive and detailed portion of his African coverage, and it has become the foundation for all subsequent historical understanding of the Soninke state. His account covers:

#### The Dual-City Capital

Al-Bakri describes the Ghana capital as consisting of two towns separated by approximately six miles (about ten kilometers):

> "The city of Ghana consists of two towns situated on a plain. One of these towns, which is inhabited by Muslims, is large and possesses twelve mosques, in one of which they assemble for the Friday prayer. There are salaried imams and muezzins, as well as jurists and scholars. In the environs are wells with sweet water, from which they drink and with which they grow vegetables. The king's town is six miles distant from this one and bears the name of El-Ghaba ["The Grove"]. Between these two towns there are continuous habitations. The houses of the inhabitants are of stone and acacia wood."

This passage reveals:

**Religious Dualism:** The separation of the Muslim merchant quarter from the royal town reflects the coexistence of Islam and indigenous religion within a single political system. The king remained a practitioner of traditional Soninke religion while hosting a substantial Muslim community. [E]

**Urban Scale:** Twelve mosques in the Muslim town alone indicates a significant population of Muslim residents — merchants, scholars, craftsmen, and their families. The "continuous habitations" between the two towns suggests a substantial urban agglomeration. [E]

**Infrastructure:** Stone buildings, wells with sweet water, vegetable gardens — these details indicate a settled, prosperous urban environment, not a collection of temporary camps. [P]

**Sacred Geography:** The royal town's name, "El-Ghaba" (The Grove), refers to the sacred forest that surrounded the king's residence and contained the tombs of former rulers. This sacred grove was central to indigenous Soninke religion. [E]

The site identification remains debated. **Koumbi Saleh** in southeastern Mauritania has been identified as the probable location of the Muslim merchant town described by al-Bakri — excavations have revealed stone buildings, mosque foundations, and other remains consistent with his description. However, the royal town (El-Ghaba) has not been definitively located. [D]

#### Court Ceremonies and Royal Display

Al-Bakri's most vivid passage describes the elaborate ceremonial through which the Ghana king displayed his power:

> "The king gives audience to his people, to listen to their complaints and set them to rights, in a domed pavilion around which stand ten horses covered with gold-embroidered cloths. Behind the king stand ten pages holding shields and gold-mounted swords. On his right hand are the sons of the subordinate kings of his country, splendidly dressed and with gold plaited into their hair. The governor of the city is seated on the ground in front of the king, and all around him are his ministers in the same position. The door of the pavilion is guarded by dogs of an excellent breed who hardly ever leave their place where the king is, and who wear collars of gold and silver, studded with balls of the same metals."

This description provides:

**Evidence of Wealth:** The ubiquitous gold — on horse trappings, swords, dogs' collars, braided into courtiers' hair — demonstrates Ghana's control of the gold trade. The king literally surrounded himself with the commodity that was the source of his power. [E]

**Political Structure:** The "sons of subordinate kings" were hostages guaranteeing their fathers' loyalty. Their presence at court demonstrates the tributary system through which Ghana maintained control over subject peoples. [P]

**Administrative Hierarchy:** The spatial arrangement of the court encodes political status: the king elevated in his pavilion, ministers seated before him on the ground, the governor in a designated position. This was not ad hoc ceremony but formalized protocol. [P]

**Judicial Function:** The audience was not merely display but functional governance — the king "listen[ed] to their complaints and set them to rights." Royal justice was publicly administered. [P]

#### The Greeting Protocols

Al-Bakri records differentiated greeting rituals for different categories of subjects:

> "When the people who profess the same religion as the king approach him, they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads, for this is their form of greeting to him. As for the Muslims, they greet him only by clapping their hands."

This passage reveals:

**Religious Categories:** The king's co-religionists (practitioners of indigenous Soninke religion) were distinguished from Muslims, and each group had its own protocol. [E]

**The Dust Greeting:** Prostration and self-abasement with dust or earth is a widespread form of royal greeting in West Africa, documented also by [[08-Primary-Sources/Arabic-Sources/PS-Ibn-Battuta|Ibn Battuta]] at the Mali court centuries later. It signifies submission to superior power. [E]

**Accommodating Muslims:** The simpler greeting for Muslims may reflect either practical accommodation of a group whose religion prohibited the more abasing form, or the different status of Muslims as valuable but essentially foreign residents. [P]

#### The Royal Funeral Customs

One of al-Bakri's most striking passages describes the burial of Ghana's kings:

> "When their king dies, they build over the place where his tomb will be an enormous dome of wood. Then they bring him on a bed covered with few carpets and cushions and place him inside the dome. At his side they place his ornaments, his weapons, and the vessels from which he used to eat and drink, filled with various kinds of food and beverages. They place there too the men who used to serve his meals. They close the door of the dome and cover it with mats and materials. Then the people assemble, who heap earth upon it until it becomes like a big hillock, and dig a ditch around it until the mound can only be approached at one point. They offer sacrifices to their dead and make libations of intoxicating beverages."

This passage documents:

**Tumulus Burial:** The construction of burial mounds (tumuli) over royal graves, a practice known archaeologically across West Africa. [E]

**Grave Goods:** The provision of food, drink, weapons, and ornaments for the dead king reflects a belief in an afterlife where the ruler would need such items. [P]

**Human Sacrifice:** The servants who brought the king's meals were buried with him. This practice — horrifying to both Muslim observers and modern readers — reflects the extreme hierarchy of Soninke society and beliefs about the king's continuing needs in death. [E]

**Ancestor Veneration:** The ongoing sacrifices and libations after burial indicate that deceased kings remained spiritually active and required continuing attention from the living. [P]

**Religious Incompatibility:** These practices could not be reconciled with Islam, which prohibits human sacrifice, the burial of grave goods, and the pouring of libations to the dead. This incompatibility helps explain why Ghana's kings resisted conversion. [P]

#### The Gold Trade Mechanism

Al-Bakri provides detailed information about how Ghana controlled the gold trade:

> "The best gold found in this land comes from Ghiyaru, which is eighteen days' journey from the city of the king... All pieces of gold that are found in the mines of this country are reserved for the king, only the gold dust being left for the people. Without this precaution, gold would become so plentiful that it would practically lose its value."

And on taxation:

> "The king of Ghana places a tax of one dinar of gold on each donkey-load of salt that enters his country, and two dinars of gold on each load of salt that goes out. From a load of copper the king's due is five mithqals, and from a load of merchandise ten mithqals."

These passages reveal:

**Royal Monopoly:** The king's monopoly on gold nuggets (leaving only dust for general circulation) represents sophisticated monetary policy designed to prevent inflation. [E]

**Differential Taxation:** Taxing exports at a higher rate than imports encouraged the importation of goods while maximizing revenue from the gold that flowed northward. [E]

**Multiple Revenue Streams:** Salt, copper, and general merchandise were all taxed at different rates, indicating a complex fiscal system. [E]

**Economic Sophistication:** Ghana's rulers understood the relationship between commodity supply and value — a level of economic thinking that challenges assumptions about African societies. [P]

### Awdaghust: A Window into the Trans-Saharan Trade

Al-Bakri's account of Awdaghust (Aoudaghost), a Saharan trading town, provides important supplementary information:

> "Awdaghust is a flourishing locality with broad markets, possessing palm trees and henna trees which produce the type of henna fruit which is similar to a fig; it is sweet to the taste but liable to bring on fever. Wheat is grown there and irrigation is achieved by hand. There are cattle and flocks of sheep and goats, and honey is plentiful... The inhabitants of Awdaghust reckon their capital in dinars, and their wealth is in dinars."

He also records that Awdaghust was captured by the Almoravids around 1054:

> "The town of Awdaghust was conquered by the Almoravids in [1054]... Before that it was in the hands of the Ghana king, who received tribute from its people."

This passage establishes:

**Ghana's Northern Reach:** Before the Almoravid conquest, Awdaghust was tributary to Ghana, demonstrating the empire's extension into the southern Sahara. [E]

**Almoravid Expansion:** The Almoravid capture of Awdaghust in 1054 was part of the movement's southward expansion, disrupting Ghana's control of the trans-Saharan trade. [E]

**Trade Town Prosperity:** Awdaghust's palm trees, agriculture, livestock, and honey indicate a substantial oasis economy supporting the trans-Saharan commerce. [E]

### The Trans-Saharan Routes

Al-Bakri maps the routes connecting North Africa to the Sudan (the Arabic term for the "land of the blacks," i.e., Sub-Saharan Africa):

> "The route from Sijilmasa to Ghana is as follows... [detailed itinerary with distances and stopping points]"

This route information is invaluable for understanding:

**The Geography of Trade:** The specific oases, wells, and staging points that made trans-Saharan commerce possible. [E]

**Travel Times:** The weeks required to cross the desert, with implications for the logistics and organization of the caravan trade. [E]

**The Role of Sijilmasa:** The Moroccan city of Sijilmasa as the primary northern terminus for the western trans-Saharan routes. [E]

### The "Silent Trade" Tradition

Al-Bakri repeats a tradition about how gold was obtained from the peoples of the forest zone:

> "The gold is brought from the land of Ghana, and from the country of Wangara, which lies to the south... The traders journey there with salt, which they sell for gold. None of them sees the gold miners, nor do they communicate with them in any way. They bring their salt, and they deposit it in heaps on the ground. Then they withdraw and depart. The people of Wangara come and bring gold, which they set down beside the salt, and go away again. Then the merchants come back and either accept the gold or leave it. If they accept it, they take it away and leave the salt. If they do not accept it, they take away neither the gold nor the salt. Then the inhabitants come again and add to the gold. Negotiation continues until agreement is reached."

This "silent trade" or "dumb barter" (*munabadha*) tradition appears in multiple Arabic sources but is **actively debated** by scholars:

**Arguments for Historicity:** The practice would protect the gold-producing communities' locations from outsiders while still enabling exchange. Similar practices have been documented in other contexts. [P]

**Arguments Against:** The identical description appears in multiple Arabic sources over centuries, suggesting it may be a literary topos rather than observed reality. By al-Bakri's time, more regular trading relationships had developed. [D]

**Current Assessment:** [D] — The silent trade may have existed in some form at some period, but the degree to which al-Bakri's account reflects actual contemporary practice versus inherited tradition is uncertain.

## Key Passages with Analysis

### Passage 1: The King's Power and Justice

> "The king of Ghana is a mighty king. In his territory are mines of gold, and he has under him a number of tributary kings... He is able to put two hundred thousand warriors into the field, more than forty thousand of them being armed with bows and arrows."

**Analysis:**

**Political Structure:** Ghana was not merely a kingdom but an imperial system with "tributary kings" subordinate to the central ruler. [E]

**Military Power:** The army figure (200,000 with 40,000+ archers) is almost certainly exaggerated — Arabic sources routinely inflated military numbers. However, the relative proportion (about 20% specialist archers) may be more meaningful than the absolute figure, suggesting differentiated military organization. [S] for the numbers; [P] for the existence of a substantial, organized military.

**Control of Gold:** The king's power was inseparable from his control of the gold trade. Al-Bakri understands the economic foundations of Ghana's political authority. [E]

### Passage 2: Religious Coexistence

> "The king's interpreters and his treasurer and most of his ministers are Muslims. Only the king and his people, being pagans, follow their native religion. The worship of idols is permitted in the lands of the king and the people of his country make libations of intoxicating liquor."

**Analysis:**

**The Muslim Administrative Class:** Key administrative positions — interpreter, treasurer, ministers — were held by Muslims, who provided the literacy and commercial expertise the state required. [E]

**Royal Religious Identity:** The king himself practiced indigenous Soninke religion, which was essential to his legitimacy among his own people. He could not convert without abandoning the religious framework that made him king. [P]

**Practical Pluralism:** This arrangement worked: Muslims handled commerce and administration, the king maintained traditional legitimacy, and both communities coexisted under a single political authority. This was not tolerance in the modern liberal sense but pragmatic compartmentalization. [P]

**Al-Bakri's Perspective:** The phrase "worship of idols" reflects al-Bakri's Muslim framework. Indigenous Soninke religion was not idol worship in any literal sense, but al-Bakri had no other conceptual vocabulary for non-monotheistic religion. [P]

### Passage 3: The Drum of Summons

> "The beginning of a royal audience is announced by the beating of a drum which they call *deba*, made of a long piece of hollowed wood. The people gather when they hear it."

**Analysis:**

**Sonic Dimension of Power:** The drum as a communication instrument extended the king's reach across distance. The ability to summon subjects through sound was a basic element of West African political culture. [E]

**Vocabulary Preservation:** Al-Bakri preserves the indigenous term *deba* for this drum, one of the few African words that survive in his text. This precision suggests informants who knew the culture intimately. [P]

**Continuity:** Drums for royal communication and summons remained a feature of West African courts for centuries, documented by later sources including Ibn Battuta and Leo Africanus. [E]

### Passage 4: Tunka Manin's Succession

> "The present king of Ghana, whose name is Tunka Manin, came to the throne by virtue of being the son of the king's sister. This is the custom among them... The kingship belongs only to the son of the king's sister. He [Tunka Manin's predecessor] ruled a long time."

**Analysis:**

**Matrilineal Succession:** Ghana practiced matrilineal succession, where the throne passed to the ruler's sister's son rather than his own son. This system, common across much of West Africa, traces royal legitimacy through women while reserving actual rule for men. [E]

**Dating Implications:** The predecessor "ruled a long time," but al-Bakri gives no information about how long Tunka Manin had reigned by 1067/68. Scholarly estimates place the beginning of Tunka Manin's reign around 1062, but this is inference. [S]

**Named Individual:** Tunka Manin is one of the few Ghanaian rulers whose name survives in written sources. The name itself may be a title (*Tunka* = chief; *Manin* is less certain) rather than a personal name. [D]

---

## Source Reliability

### Strengths

**Systematic Compilation:** Al-Bakri gathered information methodically from multiple sources, cross-checking where possible. He was not simply repeating one earlier account but synthesizing material from various informants and texts. [E]

**Contemporary Information:** Al-Bakri's description of Ghana reflects conditions in the late 1060s, not a distant past. His informants had recent, current knowledge of the Ghana court. [E]

**Critical Awareness:** Al-Bakri distinguished between what he knew from reliable sources and what was uncertain. He occasionally notes where his information is incomplete or where traditions vary. [E]

**Detail and Specificity:** The level of detail in his Ghana description — the domed pavilion, the guard dogs with gold collars, the specific tax rates — indicates informants who had observed the court firsthand or received detailed accounts from those who had. [P]

**Internal Consistency:** Al-Bakri's account is coherent and plausible. His description of Ghana's political system, economy, and religion fits together as a functioning whole, not as a collection of random exotic details. [P]

**Commercial Focus:** His informants were merchants interested in practical matters — routes, taxes, commercial conditions. This makes the commercial and economic information particularly reliable. [E]

### Limitations

**Secondhand Information:** Al-Bakri never visited Africa. Everything he knew passed through intermediaries — from the Ghana court to Saharan traders to Maghrebian merchants to al-Bakri's text. At each stage, distortion, misunderstanding, or selective emphasis was possible. [E]

**Limited Access to Indigenous Perspectives:** Al-Bakri's informants were outsiders — Arab and Berber merchants who saw Ghana from the trading quarters and the public court, not from within Soninke society. He had no access to how Ghanaians understood themselves, their religion, or their history. [P]

**Cultural Framework:** Al-Bakri interpreted what he learned through the lens of an Andalusian Muslim scholar. His categories for understanding religion, politics, and society were Arabic and Islamic, not African. He could describe what he learned, but his interpretation of meaning was necessarily limited. [P]

**Missing Information:** Al-Bakri provides almost no information about Tunka Manin as an individual — no physical description, no personality traits, no account of specific policies or events during his reign. The internal politics of the Ghana court, the relationships between the king and his subordinates, the challenges he faced — all this is invisible. [P]

**Exaggeration Risk:** Arabic sources routinely inflated numbers — army sizes, treasure quantities, distances. Al-Bakri's figure of 200,000 warriors should be treated skeptically, though the existence of a substantial military is not in doubt. [D]

**Single Snapshot:** Al-Bakri's account represents conditions at one moment (c. 1067-68). He provides little information about Ghana's past, no prediction of its future, and no comparative data from other periods that would allow tracking change over time. [P]

### Biases and Distortions

**Religious Perspective:** Al-Bakri was a Muslim writing for a Muslim audience. Non-Islamic religious practices are described as "pagan" worship of "idols," which obscures their actual content and meaning. The burial of servants with the dead king receives more attention than might a less shocking (to Muslim sensibilities) custom. [P]

**Commercial Emphasis:** The commercial interests of al-Bakri's informants shaped what they noticed and reported. Political intrigue, cultural life, and social relations receive less attention than trade routes and tax rates. [P]

**Elite Focus:** Al-Bakri describes the king and the court, not ordinary Ghanaians. The lives of farmers, artisans, and common people are invisible in his account. [P]

**The "Civilized" Standard:** Al-Bakri implicitly measured Ghana against the urban, literate, Islamic civilization of al-Andalus. He noticed mosques, markets, stone buildings, written administration — signs of "civilization" as he understood it. What he may have missed were forms of sophistication that did not fit his categories. [P]

## Information Unique to Al-Bakri

Al-Bakri's account preserves information available nowhere else. Without his text, we would not know:

**The Dual-City Layout:** The physical separation of the royal town (El-Ghaba) and the Muslim merchant quarter is documented only in al-Bakri. This detail illuminates how Ghana managed religious pluralism through spatial organization. [E]

**The Guard Dogs:** The dogs with gold and silver collars appear only in al-Bakri. This memorable detail has no parallel in other sources and presumably reflects direct observation by his informants. [E]

**The Specific Tax Rates:** Al-Bakri's precise figures for salt taxes (one dinar in, two dinars out) and other levies are unique. No other source provides this level of fiscal detail for the Ghana Empire. [E]

**The Royal Gold Monopoly:** The distinction between gold nuggets (reserved for the king) and gold dust (left for circulation), with its explicit rationale about preventing inflation, appears only in al-Bakri. [E]

**Tunka Manin's Name:** This is the only named ruler of Ghana whose name survives in contemporary (or near-contemporary) written sources. Earlier and later rulers are known only through oral tradition or much later accounts. [E]

**The Court Ceremonial Details:** The domed pavilion, the arrangement of courtiers, the differentiated greeting protocols — these specific details are unique to al-Bakri. [E]

**The Funeral Customs:** The detailed description of royal burial practices, including the burial of servants, is found only in al-Bakri. [E]

**Awdaghust's Relationship to Ghana:** Al-Bakri establishes that Awdaghust was tributary to Ghana before the Almoravid conquest — information not available elsewhere. [E]

## Scholarly Use

### Historiographic Tradition

Al-Bakri's text has been central to the study of West African history since European scholars began seriously engaging with Arabic sources in the nineteenth century. Key moments in the text's historiographic career include:

**French Colonial Scholarship:** Baron de Slane produced the first European translation (French) in 1859, revised in 1913. This made the text available to non-Arabists and established its importance for colonial historians seeking to understand the African past. [E]

**Levtzion's Work:** Nehemia Levtzion, in his *Ancient Ghana and Mali* (1973) and especially in the *Corpus of Early Arabic Sources for West African History* (with J.F.P. Hopkins, 1981), provided the standard English translation and comprehensive scholarly apparatus. Levtzion's work established the methodology for using al-Bakri and other Arabic sources in Africanist historiography. [E]

**Decolonizing Frameworks:** Post-independence African and Africanist scholars have used al-Bakri both as evidence for sophisticated pre-colonial African states and as an example of external perspectives that need to be read critically. Michael Gomez's *African Dominion* (2018) represents the current state of decolonized engagement with al-Bakri's text. [E]

### Current Assessment

Modern Africanist historians generally assess al-Bakri's account as follows:

**Essential but Partial:** Al-Bakri is indispensable for understanding the Ghana Empire, but he provides only one perspective — that of Muslim outsiders focused on commerce. He must be supplemented with archaeological evidence, oral tradition, and critical interpretation. [E]

**Reliable on Observables:** Al-Bakri's descriptions of what merchants could see — court ceremonies, urban layout, trade practices, material wealth — are generally trustworthy. His interpretations of meaning (especially religious meaning) require more caution. [P]

**Single Moment in Time:** Al-Bakri provides a snapshot of c. 1067-68, not a history of Ghana's development over time. Scholars must resist the temptation to treat his static description as representative of a long period. [P]

**The Source Problem Exemplified:** Al-Bakri's account illustrates both the value and the limitations of Arabic sources for African history. He provides detail unavailable elsewhere, but that detail is filtered through layers of transmission and cultural distance. [E]

### Key Scholarly Debates Informed by Al-Bakri

| Debate | Al-Bakri's Evidence | Scholarly Positions |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Location of Ghana's capital** | Describes dual-city layout; archaeological identification with Koumbi Saleh | Koumbi Saleh = Muslim town is [P]; royal town location unknown [D] |
| **Almoravid conquest of Ghana** | Al-Bakri, writing before the supposed conquest (1076), describes a functioning, powerful state | Used both to support (terminus ante quem) and challenge (no sign of weakness) the conquest narrative [D] |
| **Ghana's religious policy** | Documents pluralism: Muslim administrators, indigenous royal religion | Interpreted as sophisticated pragmatism or uneasy compromise depending on scholar [P] |
| **The silent trade** | Reports the tradition | Debated whether historical practice or literary convention [D] |
| **Population and scale** | Army figures (200,000) | Universally regarded as exaggerated; actual scale uncertain [S] |
| **Economic sophistication** | Gold monopoly, differential taxation | Evidence for complex economic policy, not primitive accumulation [E] |

---

## Scholarly Debates

| Question | Position A | Position B | Current Consensus |
|----------|------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Al-Bakri's informants** | Primarily merchants with direct Ghana experience | Compilation from multiple sources of varying reliability | [P] Mix of direct merchant reports and earlier texts |
| **Accuracy of court description** | Eyewitness-quality observation | Stylized, possibly exaggerated | [P] Fundamentally accurate on structure; details possibly enhanced |
| **The silent trade** | Historical practice preserved by al-Bakri | Literary topos inherited from earlier geographers | [D] May have existed; al-Bakri's account possibly conventional |
| **Army size (200,000)** | Roughly accurate indication of Ghana's power | Standard Arabic exaggeration | [S] Exaggerated; indicates perceived power, not actual count |
| **Completeness of Ghana account** | Comprehensive coverage of what was knowable | Significant gaps due to informant limitations | [P] Comprehensive for external observers; internal dynamics invisible |
| **Koumbi Saleh identification** | Archaeological site matches al-Bakri's Muslim town | Identification is convenient but not certain | [P] Probable but not definitive |

## Transmission and Survival

### Manuscript History

The *Kitab al-Masalik wa-l-Mamalik* does not survive complete in any single manuscript. What we possess are:

**Partial Manuscripts:** Several manuscripts preserve substantial portions of the text, though none contains the complete work. The most important manuscripts are held in libraries in Paris, London, and various North African collections. [E]

**Later Citations:** Portions of al-Bakri's text were quoted or incorporated into later geographic compilations (e.g., by Yaqut al-Hamawi and others), preserving material that might otherwise have been lost. [E]

**The African Sections:** The portions of the text dealing with West Africa are among the best-preserved, perhaps because of their commercial and scholarly importance. These sections were copied and transmitted more frequently than some other parts of the work. [P]

### Translation History

**French Translations:** Baron de Slane's 1859 translation (revised 1913) was the first European translation and long remained the standard for French-speaking scholarship. [E]

**English Translation:** The standard English translation of the African sections is in Levtzion & Hopkins, *Corpus of Early Arabic Sources for West African History* (1981, reprinted 2000). This translation is the reference point for most English-language scholarship. [E]

**Arabic Editions:** Critical editions of the Arabic text have been produced, most importantly by Baron de Slane and later by Krachkovskii. [E]

### Textual Issues

**Completeness:** The fragmentary survival of the text means that we may be missing material relevant to African history that was present in the original but did not survive in extant manuscripts. [P]

**Copying Errors:** Medieval manuscript transmission inevitably introduced copying errors. Names, numbers, and technical terms are particularly vulnerable to corruption. Editors have worked to identify and correct obvious errors, but some readings remain uncertain. [P]

**Later Interpolation:** The possibility that later copyists added material to al-Bakri's original text cannot be entirely excluded, though the core account is generally accepted as authentic. [P]

## For Fiction Writing

### Voice and Style

Al-Bakri wrote in clear, systematic Arabic prose appropriate to the geographic genre. His style is:

**Matter-of-Fact:** He describes remarkable things (guard dogs with gold collars, servants buried with kings) without excessive commentary or expressions of wonder. The tone is that of a scholar compiling information, not a traveler expressing amazement. [P]

**Organized:** His material is arranged logically, moving from topic to topic within each region. This systematic approach reflects the *masalik* genre's practical origins. [P]

**Precise:** He provides specific details — tax rates, distances, names — rather than vague generalizations. This precision gives his account its documentary value. [P]

**Detached:** Al-Bakri does not express strong emotions about what he describes. Even the burial of servants with dead kings receives descriptive treatment rather than moral condemnation. This detachment may reflect scholarly convention or genuine cultural relativism (within limits). [P]

**A fictional character reading al-Bakri** might notice: the systematic organization that makes information easy to find; the precision that suggests reliable sources; the occasional gaps where information was unavailable; the underlying assumption that the reader is Muslim and interested in commerce.

### Vivid Details from Al-Bakri

**Visual:**
- The domed pavilion where the king holds audience
- Ten horses covered with gold-embroidered cloths
- Pages holding shields and gold-mounted swords
- Gold plaited into the hair of hostage princes
- Guard dogs wearing gold and silver collars with bells
- Stone and acacia wood houses in the Muslim quarter
- Twelve mosques in the merchant town
- The sacred grove surrounding the royal town
- Burial mounds of former kings, covered with earth, surrounded by ditches

**Sound:**
- The *deba* drum announcing royal audiences, its deep tone carrying across the city
- The bells on the dogs' collars jingling as they move
- The muezzins' calls from twelve mosques
- The clapping of hands as Muslims greet the king
- The market sounds of a major trading center

**Smell and Taste:**
- Vegetables grown from wells with sweet water
- Intoxicating beverages poured as libations to the dead
- Food and drink placed with the dead king in his tomb

**Touch/Texture:**
- The weight of gold ornaments
- The rough texture of mud-brick and stone buildings
- The dust sprinkled on heads as a greeting

**Social Atmosphere:**
- The strict protocol of the royal audience — everyone in their designated place
- The mixture of reverence and commerce in the dual-city capital
- The coexistence of different religious communities
- The presence of hostage princes — splendidly dressed prisoners

### Perspectives and Gaps

**What Al-Bakri Reveals:**
- The public face of Ghana's power: ceremony, wealth, military strength
- The commercial infrastructure: taxes, routes, exchange mechanisms
- The religious situation: Muslim merchants alongside indigenous royal religion
- The political structure: tributary kings, administrative offices, judicial function

**What Al-Bakri Cannot See:**
- How ordinary Ghanaians lived, worked, loved, raised children
- The internal politics of the court — factions, rivalries, ambitions
- The indigenous meaning of Soninke religious practices
- How the Ghana king understood himself and his role
- Women's lives and roles (al-Bakri's Ghana is almost entirely male)
- The perspectives of subject peoples within Ghana's empire
- How people felt about living under Ghana's rule
- The personal characteristics of Tunka Manin beyond his role as king

**Dramatic Possibilities:**
- A merchant arriving at the Ghana court and experiencing the ceremonial for the first time
- The gap between what al-Bakri's informants saw and what was actually happening
- The Muslim administrators who served a "pagan" king — their ambiguous position
- The hostage princes "splendidly dressed" but prisoners
- The moment when news of al-Bakri's description (or descriptions like it) reaches Ghana — how do they feel about being observed and recorded by outsiders?

### Quotable Passages for Inspiration

> "The beginning of a royal audience is announced by the beating of a drum which they call *deba*, made of a long piece of hollowed wood. The people gather when they hear it."

*The drum summons. The city stirs. Power makes itself heard across distance.*

> "The door of the pavilion is guarded by dogs of an excellent breed who hardly ever leave their place where the king is, and who wear collars of gold and silver, studded with balls of the same metals."

*Even the dogs wear gold. This is a court where wealth speaks.*

> "On his right hand are the sons of the subordinate kings of his country, splendidly dressed and with gold plaited into their hair."

*Beautiful prisoners. Their fathers' loyalty guaranteed by their presence.*

> "Without this precaution, gold would become so plentiful that it would practically lose its value."

*The king understood economics. This was not primitive accumulation but deliberate policy.*

> "They place there too the men who used to serve his meals."

*Servants follow their master into death. The hierarchy extends beyond the grave.*

## Comparison with Other Sources

| Topic | Al-Bakri Says (c. 1068) | Other Sources Say | Assessment |
|-------|-------------------------|-------------------|------------|
| **Ghana's dual capital** | Two towns, six miles apart: royal town (El-Ghaba) and Muslim quarter with twelve mosques | No other source provides this level of detail; archaeological evidence at Koumbi Saleh consistent with Muslim town description | Al-Bakri's account is unique and generally accepted [E] |
| **Religious coexistence** | King practices indigenous religion; Muslims hold administrative posts; mosques flourish in merchant quarter | Ibn Battuta (Mali, 1352-53) describes similar dual religious system; pattern appears consistent across Sahelian empires | Al-Bakri's description fits broader pattern [E] |
| **Royal funeral with human sacrifice** | Servants buried with dead kings | Practiced elsewhere in West Africa (Ashanti, Dahomey, etc. in later periods); consistent with archaeological evidence of elite burials | Credible, consistent with regional patterns [P] |
| **The gold monopoly** | King reserves gold nuggets, leaving only dust for circulation | No other source provides this detail; economically plausible | Unique to al-Bakri; accepted as credible [E] |
| **Army size (200,000)** | Al-Bakri reports this figure | Arabic sources routinely exaggerate army sizes; no independent confirmation | Exaggerated [S] |
| **The silent trade** | Describes gold exchange without direct contact | Appears in multiple Arabic sources (Herodotus also describes similar practices elsewhere) | Possibly literary topos rather than observed practice [D] |
| **Matrilineal succession** | King succeeded by sister's son | Widely documented in West Africa; consistent with later sources | Credible, consistent with regional patterns [E] |
