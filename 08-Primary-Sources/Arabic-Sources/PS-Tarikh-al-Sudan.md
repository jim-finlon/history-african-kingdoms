## Overview

The *Tarikh al-Sudan* (*Chronicle of the Sudan*) stands as the single most important source for the history of the Songhai Empire and for understanding the catastrophic Moroccan invasion that destroyed West Africa's last great Sahelian state. Composed by Abd al-Rahman al-Sa'di, a Timbuktu scholar who lived through the post-conquest period, the chronicle provides an insider's account of a civilization at its height and in its destruction. Without the *Tarikh al-Sudan*, our knowledge of Songhai political history, the intellectual culture of Timbuktu, and the human cost of the Moroccan occupation would be fragmentary at best. With it, we possess one of the richest sources for any medieval African society. [E]

The chronicle covers the history of the western Sudan from legendary beginnings through approximately 1655, but its heart lies in two interconnected narratives: the rise and fall of the Songhai Empire (particularly the Askia dynasty, 1493-1591), and the scholarly community of Timbuktu that gave meaning to both the empire's achievements and its destruction. Al-Sa'di wrote not merely as a historian but as a witness and a mourner. He had studied with [[02-Prosopography/West-Africa/Songhai-Empire/HF-Ahmad-Baba|Ahmad Baba]], the greatest scholar Timbuktu ever produced, who had been arrested, his library confiscated, and marched across the Sahara in chains by the Moroccan occupiers. Al-Sa'di had seen the world he cherished systematically dismantled. His chronicle is both a record of what was lost and an act of preservation — an attempt to ensure that the achievements of Songhai and its scholars would not be forgotten. [E]

The *Tarikh al-Sudan* is not merely a political chronicle but a work of Sahelian intellectual history. Al-Sa'di devotes substantial attention to the scholars of Timbuktu: their biographies, their works, their relationships with rulers, and their fate under Moroccan occupation. This emphasis reflects his own position as a member of the scholarly community and his conviction that learning was as important as political power — perhaps more so, since empires fall but knowledge, preserved in manuscripts and transmitted through scholars, endures. The chronicle's dual focus on politics and scholarship makes it an invaluable source for understanding the integration of Islamic learning into West African state-building. [E]

## The Author: Abd al-Rahman al-Sa'di

### Biography

Abd al-Rahman al-Sa'di was born approximately 1596 CE (1004-1005 AH) in Timbuktu, roughly five years after the Moroccan conquest that shattered the Songhai Empire at the [[03-Battles-Campaigns/West-Africa/BC-Tondibi-1591|Battle of Tondibi]]. He thus grew up in an occupied city, under the rule of the *Arma* — the Moroccan soldiers who had remained in the Sudan after the conquest and evolved into a distinct ruling caste. His entire life was shaped by the aftermath of a catastrophe he was too young to have witnessed but whose consequences surrounded him. [E]

Al-Sa'di's family background is not fully documented, but his education indicates that he came from a scholarly lineage with the resources to support advanced learning. The name "al-Sa'di" may indicate descent from the Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas, one of the Prophet Muhammad's companions, a claim that would have conferred prestige but cannot be verified. More certain is that the family was established in Timbuktu's scholarly networks, with connections that gave the young al-Sa'di access to the city's remaining intellectual resources. [P]

His education followed the traditional curriculum of Timbuktu scholarship: Quranic memorization, Arabic grammar and rhetoric, Maliki jurisprudence, hadith (prophetic traditions), and the other Islamic sciences. Most significantly, al-Sa'di studied with Ahmad Baba al-Timbukti after the great scholar's return from Moroccan exile in 1608. Ahmad Baba had been the most eminent scholar of the pre-conquest era; studying with him connected al-Sa'di to the intellectual tradition of Songhai Timbuktu at its height. Ahmad Baba would have been in his fifties and sixties when al-Sa'di studied with him, a living repository of memories and learning from the world before the conquest. [E]

Al-Sa'di served as imam of the Sankore mosque in Timbuktu — one of the city's three great mosque-universities and the center of its scholarly life. He also served as a notary (*katib*) and as an intermediary between the scholarly community and the Arma authorities. These positions gave him access to official documents, to oral traditions preserved among the scholars, and to the practical workings of both the pre-conquest Songhai administration (through records and memories) and the post-conquest occupation. [E]

The date of al-Sa'di's death is not precisely documented but is generally placed around 1656, shortly after he completed the *Tarikh al-Sudan*. He would have been approximately sixty years old — a respectable age for the era. He died having accomplished his great work: the preservation of his people's history in a form that would survive the centuries. [P]

### Motivation and Purpose

Al-Sa'di's motivations for writing the *Tarikh al-Sudan* were multiple and intertwined:

**Preservation of memory:** The Moroccan conquest had not merely destroyed the Songhai state; it had scattered the scholarly community, confiscated libraries, and killed or exiled the keepers of historical knowledge. The generation that had witnessed Songhai at its height was dying. If their memories were not recorded, they would be lost forever. Al-Sa'di wrote to preserve what could still be preserved, racing against the mortality of his sources. [E]

**Commemoration of the scholars:** A substantial portion of the *Tarikh al-Sudan* is devoted to biographical notices of Timbuktu's scholars — their lives, their works, their virtues. Al-Sa'di saw himself as continuing a tradition of Islamic biographical literature (*tabaqat*), honoring the learned men who had made Timbuktu great and recording for posterity what they had achieved. This was an act of piety as well as scholarship. [E]

**Making sense of catastrophe:** The Moroccan conquest was, for al-Sa'di and his community, an existential rupture. The *Tarikh al-Sudan* can be read as an attempt to understand how such a disaster could have occurred — to place it within a framework of divine providence, human error, and historical causation that would make it comprehensible. Al-Sa'di does not merely record events; he interprets them. [P]

**Continuation of the chronicle tradition:** Timbuktu had a tradition of historical writing, of which the *Tarikh al-Fattash* of [[02-Prosopography/West-Africa/Scholars/HF-Mahmud-Kati|Mahmud Kati]] and his family was the most notable example. Al-Sa'di positioned his work within this tradition, drawing on earlier sources (including, probably, versions of the *Tarikh al-Fattash*) while producing an independent account that complemented rather than duplicated existing chronicles. [P]

**Legitimation and advocacy:** As an intermediary between the scholarly community and the Arma authorities, al-Sa'di had practical interests in presenting the scholars in a favorable light and in documenting their historical importance. A chronicle that demonstrated the centrality of the ulama to Songhai's greatness was also an argument for their continued relevance under Arma rule. [P]

### Relationship to Sub-Saharan Africa

Al-Sa'di was not an external observer but an insider — a native of Timbuktu, a product of its scholarly tradition, and a participant in its post-conquest struggles. This insider status is both the *Tarikh al-Sudan*'s greatest strength and a source of its biases:

**Strengths of insider perspective:**
- Direct access to the scholarly community's oral traditions and written records
- Personal knowledge of the surviving scholars, including his teacher Ahmad Baba
- Understanding of the social structures, institutions, and cultural values of Timbuktu
- Ability to read Arabic manuscripts without translation
- Emotional investment in accuracy — this was his own people's history [E]

**Limitations of insider perspective:**
- Identification with the scholarly community shapes interpretation of rulers (those who favored scholars are praised; those who did not are condemned)
- Timbuktu-centric view that may undervalue developments in other parts of the empire
- Post-conquest perspective colors the entire narrative — the reader knows the ending
- Religious framework interprets events in terms of divine will and Islamic principles [P]

### Cultural Lens

Al-Sa'di wrote within the framework of Islamic historical scholarship, which shaped his approach in several ways:

**The biographical tradition:** Islamic historiography has a strong biographical dimension, tracing the transmission of knowledge through chains of scholars (*isnad*). Al-Sa'di devotes substantial space to biographical notices, continuing a tradition that stretches back to early Islamic literature. [E]

**Moral evaluation of rulers:** Islamic political thought emphasizes the ruler's duty to uphold justice and support religion. Al-Sa'di evaluates Songhai rulers according to these criteria: those who patronized scholars and governed justly are praised; those who neglected or persecuted the learned are condemned. This is not neutral historiography but engaged moral judgment. [P]

**Divine providence:** Like other Islamic historians, al-Sa'di interpreted historical events within a framework of divine will. Victories and defeats, rises and falls, were ultimately expressions of God's plan. This framework provides the *Tarikh al-Sudan* with its moral coherence but also limits the kinds of explanations it offers for historical causation. [P]

**The Arabic literary tradition:** Al-Sa'di wrote in classical Arabic, drawing on the stylistic conventions of Arabic historical prose. His language is formal, often elegant, and assumes readers familiar with Arabic literary conventions. [E]

## The Text

### Structure and Content

The *Tarikh al-Sudan* is organized roughly chronologically but also thematically, weaving together political narrative, biographical notices, and geographic descriptions. The structure can be outlined as follows:

**Preliminary material:** The chronicle opens with conventional Islamic invocations and an explanation of the author's purpose. Al-Sa'di locates his work within the tradition of Islamic historiography and explains his reliance on oral tradition, written sources, and personal observation. [E]

**Early history of the Sudan:** The chronicle begins with legendary and semi-legendary accounts of the earliest history of the western Sudan, including traditions about the origins of various peoples and the establishment of early states. This material is largely derived from oral tradition and is less reliable than later sections. [T]

**The Sunni dynasty and Sunni Ali:** Al-Sa'di provides extensive coverage of Sunni Ali's reign (1464-1492), the warrior-king who conquered Timbuktu and Djenne and built the territorial foundation of the Songhai Empire. The portrait is largely negative, reflecting the scholarly community's grievances against a ruler who allegedly persecuted the ulama. [E]

**The Askia dynasty:** The largest portion of the chronicle is devoted to the Askia dynasty, from [[02-Prosopography/West-Africa/Songhai-Empire/HF-Askia-Muhammad-I|Askia Muhammad I]]'s seizure of power in 1493 through the succession of subsequent rulers. Al-Sa'di treats Askia Muhammad I with great admiration, portraying him as the ideal Islamic ruler — pious, learned, supportive of scholarship, and committed to governing according to Islamic law. Later Askias receive more mixed treatment depending on their relationships with the scholarly community. [E]

**The scholars of Timbuktu:** Interspersed throughout the political narrative are biographical notices of Timbuktu's scholars. These range from brief mentions to extended treatments, and they constitute one of the most valuable portions of the chronicle for intellectual history. Al-Sa'di documents the scholarly families of Timbuktu (the Aqits, the Bagayogos, the Katis, and others), their works, their chains of transmission, and their relationships with political authority. [E]

**The Moroccan conquest:** The chronicle provides detailed coverage of the Moroccan invasion of 1591: the trans-Saharan march, the [[03-Battles-Campaigns/West-Africa/BC-Tondibi-1591|Battle of Tondibi]], the fall of Gao and Timbuktu, and the systematic destruction that followed. This is among the most vivid and emotionally charged portions of the work, written by an author whose community had been devastated by the events he describes. [E]

**The Arma period:** The chronicle continues through the decades of Arma rule following the conquest, documenting the succession of pashas, their conflicts with each other and with the remnant Songhai resistance, and the gradual transformation of the Moroccan occupiers into an independent ruling caste. This section draws on al-Sa'di's direct observation and contemporary documentation. [E]

**Conclusion:** The narrative ends around 1655, with al-Sa'di in his late fifties and the chronicle presumably completed shortly before his death. The ending is not dramatically conclusive — the Arma regime continued — but rather reflects the natural end of the author's life and knowledge. [E]

### Key Passages

The *Tarikh al-Sudan* contains numerous passages of exceptional historical and literary value. The following represent some of the most significant for this project:

#### On Sunni Ali's Character

> "He was a man of great strength and ruthless disposition, who showed no mercy to those who opposed him and no compassion to those who submitted. He persecuted the learned and pious, showing contempt for their knowledge and their station. The scholars fled before him as birds flee before the hawk, and those who remained suffered his tyranny."

This passage exemplifies al-Sa'di's hostile portrayal of Sunni Ali, reflecting the scholarly community's grievances. Modern historians debate how much of this characterization reflects actual religious persecution versus political conflict. [E]

#### On Askia Muhammad I's Hajj

> "In the year 901 [1495-1496 CE], the Askia, may God have mercy on him, resolved to perform the pilgrimage to the sacred House of God. He prepared for the journey with gold sufficient for his needs and the needs of his companions, and he took with him three hundred thousand mithqals of gold. He crossed the desert with a great caravan, suffering hardships that only God knows, until he reached the land of Egypt. There he met the Commander of the Faithful [the Abbasid caliph] who invested him with the turban and the sword and named him Caliph of the Sudan."

This account of Askia Muhammad I's pilgrimage provides crucial documentation of one of the most significant political-religious events in West African history. [E]

#### On the Battle of Tondibi

> "When the two armies met at Tondibi, the army of the Askia attacked with the cattle in front, thinking to scatter the Moroccan lines. But when the Moroccans fired their guns, the sound was like thunder such as the people of the Sudan had never heard, and the cattle turned back upon the army of the Askia, and their ranks were broken. Then the Moroccan guns continued to fire, and the cavalry of the Sudan fell before them like grass before the scythe, for they had no weapons that could reach the enemy at such a distance."

This vivid account of Tondibi captures the technological asymmetry that decided the battle — firearms against cavalry tactics developed over centuries for a different kind of warfare. [E]

#### On Ahmad Baba's Arrest

> "In that year [1593 CE], the Pasha Mahmud [Zarqun] ordered the arrest of the faqih Ahmad Baba, may God have mercy on him, and with him other scholars and notables of Timbuktu. They were taken from their homes, their libraries were seized, and they were bound in chains. The people of the city wept to see them led away, for these were the most learned and pious men among them, who had done no wrong except to possess knowledge and dignity."

Al-Sa'di's account of Ahmad Baba's arrest — Ahmad Baba was his own teacher — captures the personal tragedy within the larger catastrophe. [E]

#### On the Destruction of Timbuktu's Scholarly Culture

> "Before the Moroccan conquest, the people of Timbuktu lived in learning and piety, and their scholars were famous throughout the lands of Islam. But after the conquest, their condition changed entirely. Their libraries were scattered, their schools were disrupted, their scholars were killed or exiled, and those who remained lived in fear. The light that had shone from Sankore was dimmed, and the learning of the Sudan suffered a blow from which it has not recovered in my lifetime."

This passage articulates the chronicle's central lament: the destruction of a scholarly civilization by military force. [E]

#### On the Scholarly Community's Values

> "Know that the scholars of Timbuktu valued three things above all others: knowledge, piety, and the independence to speak truth to power. They served rulers not for wealth or advancement but because proper governance requires the guidance of the learned. A king without scholars is like a ship without a compass, drifting wherever the winds take it."

This passage reveals al-Sa'di's ideological commitments and provides insight into the scholarly community's self-understanding. [P]

## Historical Value

### What This Source Tells Us

The *Tarikh al-Sudan* is indispensable for multiple aspects of West African history:

**Songhai political history:** The chronicle provides the most detailed narrative of the Songhai Empire's political development, from Sunni Ali's conquests through the succession of Askia rulers to the Moroccan destruction. Without it, we would have only fragmentary knowledge of Songhai's administrative structure, its territorial extent, and the dynamics of its ruling dynasty. [E]

**Timbuktu's intellectual culture:** Al-Sa'di's biographical notices constitute our richest source for the scholarly community of Timbuktu — who the scholars were, what they wrote, how they were educated, and how they related to political authority. This material is essential for understanding West African Islamic intellectual history. [E]

**The Moroccan invasion and its aftermath:** The chronicle provides detailed documentation of the 1591 invasion, the Battle of Tondibi, the occupation of the Niger Bend cities, and the destruction of Songhai's scholarly and political institutions. As an insider account written within living memory of the events, it offers perspectives unavailable from external sources. [E]

**Social and economic information:** Though primarily focused on politics and scholarship, the chronicle contains valuable information about trade, social structure, religious practice, and daily life in the Songhai period. References to gold and salt trade, to the organization of markets, to the relationships between ethnic groups, and to the practices of urban life provide essential context for understanding Sahelian society. [P]

**Post-conquest developments:** For the Arma period (1591-1655), the *Tarikh al-Sudan* is often our only detailed source, documenting the succession of pashas, their conflicts, and the gradual transformation of the Moroccan occupation into something new. [E]

### Strengths

**Insider knowledge:** Al-Sa'di wrote from within the community he described, with access to oral traditions, written documents, and personal networks unavailable to external observers. His knowledge of Timbuktu's scholarly families was intimate and detailed. [E]

**Access to earlier sources:** Al-Sa'di drew on chronicles and documents that are now lost, preserving information that would otherwise have disappeared entirely. His references to earlier written sources indicate a substantial tradition of historical writing in Timbuktu that he inherited and continued. [P]

**Eyewitness perspective for post-1591 period:** For the decades following the conquest, al-Sa'di wrote from personal observation and contemporary documentation. His accounts of Arma governance are those of an informed participant, not a distant observer. [E]

**Connection to Ahmad Baba:** Al-Sa'di's personal relationship with Ahmad Baba gave him access to the memories of the pre-conquest era's greatest scholar, connecting him to the intellectual world of Songhai at its height. Ahmad Baba's recollections inform al-Sa'di's treatment of the period before his own birth. [E]

**Literary quality:** The *Tarikh al-Sudan* is well-written Arabic prose, clear in structure and often vivid in description. Al-Sa'di was a skilled author who crafted a narrative that is readable as well as informative. [P]

### Limitations

**Scholarly community perspective:** Al-Sa'di wrote as a member of the ulama, and his perspective reflects their interests and biases. Rulers are evaluated primarily by their treatment of scholars; other dimensions of governance receive less attention. The scholarly community's grievances against Sunni Ali shape the chronicle's hostile portrayal of him, which may or may not reflect historical reality. [E]

**Post-conquest retrospection:** The entire chronicle is written in the shadow of the Moroccan conquest. Al-Sa'di knew how the story ended, and this knowledge shapes his narrative — the Askia dynasty's achievements are colored by the awareness of coming disaster, and the signs of decline are perhaps emphasized because the reader knows the outcome. [P]

**Geographic focus on Timbuktu:** While the chronicle covers the broader Songhai Empire, its perspective is centered on Timbuktu. Events at Gao, Djenne, or provincial centers receive less attention than events in the city al-Sa'di knew best. This creates potential distortions in understanding Songhai as a whole. [P]

**Religious framework:** Al-Sa'di interpreted history within an Islamic framework of divine providence and moral causation. This provides the narrative with coherence and meaning but also limits the kinds of explanations he offers. Political and economic factors are sometimes subordinated to moral and religious interpretation. [P]

**Gaps in early history:** For periods before the fifteenth century, al-Sa'di relied on oral tradition and earlier sources of uncertain reliability. His accounts of early Sudanese history should be treated as traditional material rather than established fact. [T]

### Biases and Distortions

**The Sunni Ali problem:** The chronicle's extremely negative portrayal of Sunni Ali has generated substantial scholarly debate. Al-Sa'di presents him as a persecutor of scholars and a practitioner of indigenous religion — essentially an enemy of Islam. Modern historians have questioned whether this characterization reflects actual religious failings or the partisan perspective of scholars whom Sunni Ali marginalized for political reasons. The chronicle's hostility to Sunni Ali may tell us more about the scholarly community's grievances than about Sunni Ali's actual character. [D]

**The Askia Muhammad I idealization:** Conversely, the chronicle's treatment of Askia Muhammad I is highly favorable, presenting him as the ideal Islamic ruler. This portrayal served the interests of the scholarly community that Muhammad had patronized and provided a model for proper ruler-scholar relations. The idealization may smooth over complexities in the actual relationship. [P]

**Undervaluation of non-scholarly achievements:** The chronicle's focus on learning means that other aspects of Songhai civilization — military organization, agricultural development, artistic production — receive less attention than they might deserve. The empire was not only a scholarly civilization, but al-Sa'di's perspective emphasizes that dimension. [P]

**Retrospective mourning:** The *Tarikh al-Sudan* is, at its core, a lament for a lost world. This elegiac tone may lead to idealization of the pre-conquest era and perhaps to insufficient attention to the problems and conflicts that weakened Songhai before the Moroccan invasion. [P]

## Transmission and Survival

### Manuscript History

The *Tarikh al-Sudan* survived through manuscript transmission in the traditional Islamic manner: copies were made by hand, passed from scholar to scholar and library to library, with each copy potentially introducing variations, corrections, and errors. Several manuscript copies survive, held in various collections:

**Timbuktu manuscripts:** Copies of the *Tarikh al-Sudan* are held in private family collections and institutional repositories in Timbuktu. The Ahmed Baba Institute (now the Ahmed Baba Centre for Documentation and Research) has catalogued multiple copies, though their preservation has been threatened by political instability, including the 2012-2013 occupation of northern Mali by Islamist militants. [E]

**European collections:** Colonial-era scholars and administrators acquired or copied manuscripts of the *Tarikh al-Sudan*, resulting in copies held at the Bibliotheque nationale de France, the British Library, and other European institutions. These copies were the basis for the first European editions and translations. [E]

**Variations between manuscripts:** Like most manuscripts transmitted over centuries, copies of the *Tarikh al-Sudan* show variations — differences in wording, occasional additions or omissions, and scribal errors. Scholarly editors have compared multiple manuscripts to establish the most reliable text. [P]

### Translation History

The *Tarikh al-Sudan* was first made accessible to European scholarship through French translation:

**Houdas edition (1898-1900):** Octave Houdas produced the first complete European edition and translation, published as *Tarikh es-Soudan* with Arabic text and French translation. This edition remained the standard for nearly a century and was the basis for most scholarly work on Songhai history before the late twentieth century. [E]

**Hunwick edition (1999):** John O. Hunwick's *Timbuktu and the Songhay Empire* (Brill, 1999) provides a definitive English translation of the *Tarikh al-Sudan* through 1613, with extensive scholarly apparatus including introduction, notes, and additional documents. This translation has become the standard English-language reference. [E]

**Hunwick's translation covers the chronicle through 1613, not the full text to 1655. For the later Arma period, scholars must still rely on Houdas or consult the Arabic original.** [E]

### Textual Issues

**Completeness:** The *Tarikh al-Sudan* as we have it appears to be substantially complete — al-Sa'di brought his narrative to a natural stopping point shortly before his death. Unlike the *Tarikh al-Fattash*, there is no significant scholarly debate about major interpolations or later additions. [E]

**Dating problems:** Some dates in the chronicle appear to be scribal errors, requiring scholarly correction. Hunwick's translation includes notes identifying apparent dating problems and proposing corrections. [P]

**Lost sources:** Al-Sa'di drew on earlier written sources that are now lost. His references to these sources are valuable evidence that Timbuktu's chronicle tradition extended back before the sixteenth century, but we cannot independently verify his use of them. [P]

## Scholarly Reception

### Historiographic Tradition

The *Tarikh al-Sudan* has been central to the modern study of West African history since its first European publication:

**Colonial-era scholarship:** European historians of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries used the chronicle to reconstruct the political history of the Sahel, often within frameworks that undervalued African achievement or assumed European norms. The *Tarikh al-Sudan* was treated primarily as a source of facts to be extracted rather than as a sophisticated historical work in its own right. [P]

**Post-independence African historiography:** With the rise of African-centered historical scholarship in the 1960s and after, the *Tarikh al-Sudan* gained new significance as evidence for the sophistication of pre-colonial African civilization. Scholars like Nehemia Levtzion and John Hunwick placed the chronicle within the context of Islamic historiographical tradition and African intellectual history. [E]

**Decolonizing approaches:** Recent scholarship has emphasized the *Tarikh al-Sudan* as an African work — a chronicle written by an African scholar about African societies, within the framework of Islamic civilization that Africans had made their own. This framing challenges older approaches that treated Arabic sources on Africa as "external" and recognizes the indigenous character of the Timbuktu scholarly tradition. [E]

### Current Assessment

Modern Africanist historians regard the *Tarikh al-Sudan* as:

**Essential but not uncritical source:** The chronicle is indispensable for Songhai history, but its biases — particularly regarding Sunni Ali and the scholarly community's interests — require critical reading. Scholars use it in conjunction with other sources (archaeological evidence, the *Tarikh al-Fattash*, Arabic external sources) rather than as sole authority. [E]

**Evidence for African intellectual history:** Beyond its political narrative, the chronicle is valued as evidence for the sophistication of West African Islamic scholarship. Al-Sa'di's work demonstrates that Africans were producing historical literature of high quality in the same period as their European contemporaries. [E]

**Window into cultural values:** The chronicle reveals not only what happened but how educated Timbuktu scholars understood their world — their values, their conception of proper governance, their relationship to the broader Islamic community, and their sense of identity. [P]

## Scholarly Debates

| Question | Position A | Position B | Current Consensus |
|----------|------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Reliability of Sunni Ali portrayal** | The hostile characterization reflects genuine religious persecution and scholarly opposition | The portrayal is biased; Sunni Ali's conflicts with scholars were primarily political | [D] Bias acknowledged; kernel of truth in conflict, but characterization is partisan |
| **Al-Sa'di's sources for pre-1591** | He drew on reliable earlier chronicles and oral tradition with historical value | Much early material is legendary or shaped by retrospection | [P] Mix of valuable sources and legendary material; critical assessment required |
| **Relationship to *Tarikh al-Fattash*** | Independent works with distinct perspectives and source bases | Significant overlap and possible borrowing between the two chronicles | [D] Largely independent but sharing some common sources and traditions |
| **Reliability of numbers (army sizes, populations)** | Chronicles preserve genuine estimates from contemporary sources | Numbers are conventional exaggerations requiring substantial correction | [P] Numbers should be treated skeptically; relative scale more reliable than absolutes |
| **Al-Sa'di's objectivity on Arma period** | As an intermediary with the Arma, he presents a relatively balanced view | His position required accommodation that shapes his perspective | [P] Generally reliable but aware of his practical position under Arma rule |

### The Sunni Ali Debate

The *Tarikh al-Sudan*'s portrayal of [[02-Prosopography/West-Africa/Songhai-Empire/HF-Sunni-Ali|Sunni Ali]] as a persecutor of scholars and practitioner of indigenous religion remains the most contested aspect of the chronicle. Key considerations:

**Evidence for the hostile portrayal:** Al-Sa'di records specific incidents of persecution: scholars killed or forced to flee, contempt for learning, heterodox religious statements. These accounts presumably draw on the memories of the scholarly community, transmitted to al-Sa'di through his teachers. [E]

**Evidence for bias:** Al-Sa'di wrote as a member of the scholarly community, which had obvious reasons to vilify a ruler who had marginalized them. His teacher Ahmad Baba came from a tradition that benefited from the Askia dynasty's patronage and contrasted that patronage with Sunni Ali's alleged persecution. The hostile portrayal served both historical memory and ideological purpose. [E]

**Modern interpretations:** Some scholars suggest that Sunni Ali's "persecution" may have been political marginalization of a potential rival power center rather than religious opposition. Others note that the tension between military rulers and religious scholars was common throughout Islamic history and does not necessarily indicate anti-Islamic sentiment on the ruler's part. The debate remains open. [D]

### The Source Problem

For periods before al-Sa'di's lifetime, the chronicle's reliability depends on the quality of his sources — and those sources are largely lost. Scholars have attempted to assess what al-Sa'di drew upon:

**Earlier chronicles:** Al-Sa'di refers to written sources, including probably versions of the *Tarikh al-Fattash* and other chronicles now lost. These references suggest that Timbuktu had a substantial tradition of historical writing before al-Sa'di's time. [P]

**Oral tradition:** Much of the chronicle's information derives from oral tradition — the memories of the scholarly community transmitted through teaching relationships. Ahmad Baba, al-Sa'di's teacher, would have been a crucial source for the pre-conquest era. [E]

**Official documents:** Al-Sa'di's position as notary gave him access to administrative documents, though how extensively he used such sources is unclear. [P]

**The loss of sources:** The Moroccan conquest and its aftermath destroyed many manuscripts and scattered the communities that transmitted oral tradition. Al-Sa'di may have been working with incomplete and fragmentary sources, even for relatively recent periods. [P]

## Relationship to *Tarikh al-Fattash*

The *Tarikh al-Sudan* is often discussed alongside the *[[08-Primary-Sources/Arabic-Sources/PS-Tarikh-al-Fattash|Tarikh al-Fattash]]*, the other great Timbuktu chronicle. The two works cover overlapping periods and share concerns, but they differ in significant ways:

### Complementary Coverage

**Temporal emphasis:** The *Tarikh al-Fattash*, begun by Mahmud Kati around 1519, emphasizes the pre-conquest Songhai period, particularly the Askia dynasty's foundation and early glory. The *Tarikh al-Sudan*, written after the conquest, provides more detailed coverage of the Moroccan invasion and its aftermath. Together, the two chronicles span the entire arc of Songhai history. [E]

**Authorial perspective:** Mahmud Kati (if the traditional dates are accepted) was a contemporary of Askia Muhammad I who may have accompanied the ruler on his hajj. Al-Sa'di was born after the conquest and knew the pre-conquest era only through sources and memories. The *Tarikh al-Fattash* offers the perspective of an eyewitness to Songhai's rise; the *Tarikh al-Sudan* offers the perspective of one who witnessed its fall. [P]

**Family connections:** The two chronicles derive from different scholarly families. The *Tarikh al-Fattash* was a Kati family project; the *Tarikh al-Sudan* was al-Sa'di's individual work, though he was connected to other scholarly networks (including the Aqit family through his teacher Ahmad Baba). These different family connections give the chronicles access to different oral traditions and documentary sources. [P]

### Using the Two Chronicles Together

Modern scholars typically use the two chronicles in conjunction:

**Cross-verification:** Where the two chronicles agree on facts, confidence in those facts is increased. Where they differ, the differences themselves are informative about perspective and source. [P]

**Gap-filling:** Each chronicle contains material not found in the other. The *Tarikh al-Fattash* provides details about the early Askia period that the *Tarikh al-Sudan* lacks; the *Tarikh al-Sudan* provides detailed coverage of the post-1591 period that falls outside the *Tarikh al-Fattash*'s scope (as originally composed by Mahmud Kati). [E]

**Perspective comparison:** The two chronicles sometimes frame events differently, reflecting their authors' positions and purposes. Comparing these framings illuminates the perspectives of different elements within Timbuktu's scholarly community. [P]

### The Interpolation Problem

A significant complication in using the *Tarikh al-Fattash* alongside the *Tarikh al-Sudan* is the demonstrated presence of later interpolations in the former. Mauro Nobili's recent scholarship has shown that the *Tarikh al-Fattash* underwent substantial revision in the nineteenth century, with passages added to support the claims of the Masina Empire's rulers. This finding means that some material in the *Tarikh al-Fattash* as we have it may postdate the *Tarikh al-Sudan* rather than predating it. [E]

The *Tarikh al-Sudan*, by contrast, appears to be substantially free of later interpolations. Its textual stability makes it, in some ways, a more reliable witness to the sixteenth-century Timbuktu chronicle tradition than the more extensively revised *Tarikh al-Fattash*. [E]

## For Fiction Writing

### Voice and Style

The *Tarikh al-Sudan* is written in formal classical Arabic, the scholarly language of the Islamic world. Al-Sa'di's prose is:

**Measured and authoritative:** He writes as a scholar addressing posterity, with the dignity appropriate to his subject matter. The tone is not casual but neither is it pompous — it is the voice of a learned man recording what he has seen and learned. [P]

**Occasionally vivid:** Despite the formal register, al-Sa'di is capable of vivid description, particularly in passages dealing with dramatic events like the Battle of Tondibi or the arrest of scholars. He was not merely a compiler but a literary craftsman. [P]

**Morally engaged:** Al-Sa'di does not pretend to neutrality. He praises those he admires, condemns those he despises, and interprets events according to Islamic principles. His voice is that of a participant, not a detached observer. [P]

**Elegiac:** Underlying the chronicle is a profound sense of loss. Al-Sa'di wrote about a world that had been destroyed, and that awareness permeates his narrative. The *Tarikh al-Sudan* is, at its heart, a mourning. [P]

### Vivid Details

The *Tarikh al-Sudan* provides rich material for sensory reconstruction of the Songhai world:

**Timbuktu's scholarly culture:**
- Teaching circles at the great mosques: Djinguereber, Sankore, Sidi Yahia
- Manuscript libraries accumulated over generations
- The book market where manuscripts were valued more highly than gold
- Scholars in white robes debating points of law and grammar
- The call to prayer structuring the rhythm of intellectual life
- Students traveling from across the Sahel to study with Timbuktu's masters

**Court life under the Askias:**
- The Askia seated on a raised platform, receiving petitions and embassies
- Griots praising the ruler's genealogy and achievements
- The hierarchy of officials with their specialized titles: Kurmina-fari, Dendi-fari, Hi-koy, Balama
- Royal audiences with scholars consulting on matters of Islamic law
- The drums and horns that announced the ruler's movements

**The Battle of Tondibi:**
- The Songhai army arrayed with cavalry in front, infantry behind
- The cattle intended for the stampede, nervous in the morning light
- The Moroccan arquebusiers in their ranks, matches smoldering
- The crash of gunfire — a sound the Sahel had never heard
- Cavalry falling at distances where their weapons were useless
- The rout, the pursuit, the slaughter

**The Moroccan occupation:**
- Soldiers in unfamiliar uniforms walking Timbuktu's streets
- Scholars' houses being searched, libraries confiscated
- The leading men of the city led away in chains
- The caravans of prisoners crossing the Sahara northward
- The Arma establishing themselves in the city, intermarrying with local women
- The gradual transformation of conquerors into a new ruling caste

### Quotable Passages

For fiction writers, the *Tarikh al-Sudan* provides not only information but language and imagery:

On the importance of scholarship:
> "The scholars of Timbuktu were the light of the Sudan. Where they gathered, learning flourished; where they were scattered, ignorance prevailed."

On the Moroccan conquest:
> "The guns of the Moroccans were like the bolts of heaven, striking down those they could not reach with sword or lance. Against such weapons, courage and skill availed nothing."

On Ahmad Baba's exile:
> "He was taken from Timbuktu in chains, he who had never harmed any man, whose only wealth was his knowledge and whose only power was his pen."

On the passage of time:
> "All that Sunni Ali built and all that the Askias achieved have passed away, and the cities that were great are diminished. But the learning of the scholars, preserved in books and transmitted through students, endures."

### Perspectives and Gaps

**What the chronicle reveals:**
- The intellectual culture of Timbuktu at its height
- The political history of the Songhai Empire from the scholarly perspective
- The catastrophe of the Moroccan conquest and its human cost
- The values and self-understanding of the ulama
- The mechanisms of Islamic governance in a Sahelian state

**What the chronicle obscures or ignores:**
- The perspectives of non-scholars: merchants, farmers, craftsmen, slaves
- The viewpoints of ethnic groups outside the Songhai-Timbuktu elite
- The experiences of women (almost entirely absent from the narrative)
- Religious practices outside official Islam (indigenous religion, popular Sufism)
- Economic and technological development (mentioned but not the focus)
- Military organization and tactics (described but not analyzed in depth)

For fiction writers, these gaps represent opportunities. The *Tarikh al-Sudan* provides a framework; the gaps invite creative exploration of the perspectives it does not represent.
