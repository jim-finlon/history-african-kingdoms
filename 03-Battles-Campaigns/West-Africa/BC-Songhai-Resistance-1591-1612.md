## Overview

The Moroccan conquest of the Songhai Empire at Tondibi (March 12, 1591) was catastrophic but not complete. While Judar Pasha's firearms shattered the Songhai army and captured the empire's cities, the military disaster did not translate into political submission. For over two decades, Songhai loyalists waged a determined guerrilla resistance against the Moroccan occupiers, contesting control of the countryside, ambushing supply columns, and mounting periodic counteroffensives that threatened to expel the invaders entirely. The resistance ultimately failed to restore the empire, but it succeeded in making the occupation permanently precarious and prohibitively expensive. [E]

The resistance was led by a succession of Askias — Songhai claimants to the throne who refused to accept Moroccan supremacy. Askia Ishaq II, who had lost at Tondibi, was killed within months of the defeat. His successors — particularly Askia Nuh (r. 1591-1599), the most effective resistance leader — waged war from the countryside and the southeastern Dendi region, which became the refuge of the Songhai state-in-exile. The Moroccans, for their part, controlled Gao, Timbuktu, and Djenne but found the territory outside the city walls hostile and ungovernable. Their supply lines stretched across the Sahara, a five-month journey that made reinforcement difficult and expensive. Every Pasha who commanded the occupation faced the same fundamental problem: victory in battle did not translate into control of the countryside. [E]

The resistance gradually fragmented after Askia Nuh's death in 1599, with competing Askias unable to coordinate their efforts and regional powers (Tuareg, Fulani, remnant provincial governors) pursuing their own interests. By 1612, organized resistance had largely ceased, though sporadic violence continued for years afterward. The Songhai Empire, as a unified polity, was dead. In its place emerged a political landscape of competing powers: the Arma (the descendants of the Moroccan soldiers, who intermarried with local populations and became a distinct ruling class), various Songhai successor states including the Dendi kingdom, Tuareg confederations, and independent towns. The era of the great Sahelian empires — Ghana, Mali, Songhai — was over. The political fragmentation that followed the Moroccan conquest would persist until the nineteenth-century jihads created new state structures on different foundations. [E]

## Background and Causes

### Political Context: The Aftermath of Tondibi

The Battle of Tondibi on March 12, 1591, destroyed the Songhai field army but not the structures of the Songhai state. The empire had been built over more than a century by Sunni Ali, Askia Muhammad I, and their successors; it possessed provincial governors, military garrisons, tax collectors, Islamic judges, and a bureaucracy that extended across a territory the size of Western Europe. All of this did not disappear when the cavalry fell before Moroccan muskets. Instead, the empire fractured into its constituent parts, each fragment responding differently to the conquest. [E]

**The cities fell quickly:** Gao surrendered after Tondibi without further resistance. Timbuktu, the city of learning, capitulated within weeks. Djenne, the great trading center, opened its gates to Moroccan forces. The cities had walls, but they depended on the countryside for food and on the Niger River for commerce; besieged, they could not hold out independently. The Moroccan strategy of seizing the urban centers made military sense: control the cities, control the trade, control the tax revenue that had sustained the Songhai state. [E]

**The countryside remained unconquered:** But the cities were islands in a sea of hostile territory. The peasant farmers of the Niger floodplain, the Tuareg nomads of the desert fringe, the provincial elites who had served the Askias — these populations had not surrendered. Many had fled the initial conquest, taking livestock, stored grain, and portable wealth with them. Others stayed but refused to cooperate with the new rulers. The Moroccan garrison was too small to police the vast territory; soldiers who ventured beyond the city walls risked ambush. [E]

**The Askia lived:** Askia Ishaq II had escaped the battlefield at Tondibi. Though defeated, he retained the legitimacy of his office and the loyalty of many Songhai subjects. His survival made him a rallying point for resistance. The same was true for other members of the royal family and for the provincial governors who commanded regional loyalty. As long as alternative authorities existed, the Moroccan claim to rule the Songhai territories remained contested. [P]

### Immediate Cause: Moroccan Occupation Policy

The Moroccan occupation was extractive and violent from the beginning. Sultan Ahmad al-Mansur had sent the expedition across the Sahara to seize gold; his commanders understood their mission as wealth extraction, not governance. The treatment of the conquered population reflected this orientation:

**Looting:** Moroccan soldiers systematically plundered Gao, Timbuktu, and Djenne. Private homes, markets, and storehouses were searched for valuables. The *Tarikh al-Sudan* records the despair of Timbuktu's residents as their accumulated wealth was seized. [E]

**Taxation:** The Moroccan pashas imposed heavy taxes on the conquered territories — heavier, according to the chronicles, than the Songhai Askias had demanded. The tax burden fell on populations already impoverished by war and displacement. [P]

**Repression of scholars:** The scholarly community of Timbuktu, which had provided intellectual leadership for the Songhai state, was targeted for suppression. The arrest and deportation of Ahmad Baba al-Timbukti and other leading scholars in 1593 was both a political act (eliminating potential resistance leaders) and a cultural catastrophe (destroying the institutional base of Sahelian Islamic learning). The scholars had not taken up arms, but their moral authority threatened Moroccan legitimacy. Their exile made the occupation's character unmistakable. [E]

**Military brutality:** Moroccan forces dealt harshly with suspected resistance. Villages that aided the Askia's forces were burned; prisoners were enslaved or executed. The violence created a cycle of retaliation that made pacification impossible. [P]

### Strategic Objectives

**Songhai objectives:**
- Expulsion of the Moroccan invaders
- Restoration of the Askia dynasty and the pre-conquest political order
- Protection of surviving populations and economic resources
- Preservation of cultural and religious institutions (mosques, scholarly traditions, trade networks)
- When full restoration became impossible: survival of Songhai political identity in any viable form

**Moroccan objectives:**
- Consolidation of control over conquered cities
- Extraction of gold and other wealth to justify the expedition's cost
- Pacification of the countryside to secure supply lines
- Maintenance of a viable garrison at minimal cost to Morocco
- Eventually: survival as a self-sustaining colonial enclave when support from Marrakesh diminished

## The Belligerents

### Songhai Loyalist Forces

**Commanders:**

The resistance was led by a succession of Askias, claimants to the Songhai throne who refused to accept Moroccan supremacy:

**[[02-Prosopography/West-Africa/Songhai-Empire/HF-Askia-Ishaq-II|Askia Ishaq II]] (r. 1588-1591):** The ruler defeated at Tondibi. He fled the battlefield and attempted to rally resistance from the Dendi region but was killed within months — murdered by his own entourage, according to some accounts, or killed in a skirmish with Moroccan forces, according to others. His short post-Tondibi career demonstrated that the Askia title still commanded loyalty but also that the defeat had fatally weakened his personal authority. [E]

**Askia Muhammad Gao (r. 1591-1592):** Briefly ruled the Songhai remnant after Ishaq II's death. His reign was too short to mount effective resistance. The title "Gao" suggests he may have briefly reoccupied the old capital. [P]

**Askia Nuh (r. 1591-1599):** The most effective resistance leader. Nuh established a base in the Dendi region (the southeastern portion of the old empire, along the Niger River south of Gao) and waged sustained guerrilla warfare against the Moroccans. He mounted several major offensives that threatened to recapture Gao and Timbuktu. His eight-year resistance represents the high point of the anti-Moroccan struggle. After his death (reportedly from illness in 1599), the resistance fragmented. [E]

**Askia al-Mustafa (r. 1599-?):** Succeeded Askia Nuh and continued resistance at a lower intensity. By this point, the unified Songhai resistance had fractured into competing factions. [P]

**Askia Muhammad Benkan (r. early 1600s):** One of several late-resistance Askias whose claims competed with each other. The proliferation of rival Askias after 1599 reflected the fragmentation of Songhai political authority. [P]

**Provincial commanders:** Beyond the Askias, local military commanders — provincial governors who had served under the old regime, war chiefs who commanded regional followings — led their own resistance efforts. The decentralized nature of Songhai provincial administration meant that these commanders had some autonomous capacity for military action. [P]

**Forces:**

**Cavalry:** The core of the Songhai military tradition. The empire had built its power on mounted warriors equipped with swords, spears, and javelins. The cavalry had been devastated at Tondibi, but survivors and new recruits formed the backbone of the resistance army. Cavalry was essential for mobility — raiding Moroccan outposts, ambushing supply columns, evading pursuit. [E]

**Infantry:** Provincial levies and warrior communities provided foot soldiers. Less prestigious than the cavalry but essential for holding territory and conducting sieges. [P]

**Composition estimates:** The size of Songhai resistance forces varied enormously depending on the moment. At peak mobilization (during Askia Nuh's major offensives), the forces may have numbered 10,000-15,000. During low points, a few thousand warriors operating in scattered bands. These figures are speculative; the chronicles provide occasional battle descriptions but no systematic accounting. [S]

**Strengths:**
- Knowledge of terrain (the Niger floodplain, the Sahel margins, the routes and water sources)
- Popular support in the countryside (peasants, nomads, merchants who preferred Songhai rule)
- Mobility (cavalry and riverine movement along the Niger)
- Legitimacy (the Askia title still commanded loyalty among Songhai subjects)
- Supply (operating in home territory, with access to local food and fodder)

**Weaknesses:**
- No firearms (the technological asymmetry that had decided Tondibi persisted)
- Internal divisions (competing Askias, provincial rivalries, ethnic tensions between Songhai, Tuareg, and other groups)
- No external support (unlike the Moroccans, who at least initially received reinforcement from Marrakesh)
- Economic disruption (the conquest had damaged the trade networks that had sustained the empire's wealth)

### Moroccan Occupation Force (Arma)

**Commanders:**

**[[02-Prosopography/West-Africa/Songhai-Empire/HF-Judar-Pasha|Judar Pasha]] (commander 1590-1593):** The Spanish-born eunuch who led the original expedition and won at Tondibi. Judar occupied Gao and Timbuktu but grew frustrated with the resistance and the absence of the expected gold. He was recalled to Morocco in 1593, replaced by a harder line commander. He returned for a second expedition in 1599 but achieved little additional success. [E]

**Mahmud ibn Zarqun (Pasha 1593-1595):** Replaced Judar with a mandate to suppress resistance more aggressively. Mahmud escalated the violence, most notably ordering the arrest and deportation of Timbuktu's scholars in 1593. He was killed in battle against Songhai resistance forces in 1595 — a significant victory for Askia Nuh that demonstrated the Moroccans' vulnerability. [E]

**Subsequent Pashas:** A succession of commanders held the post of Pasha of Timbuktu (the title used for the head of the occupation force). Their names appear in the chronicles: Mansur ibn Abd al-Rahman, Muhammad al-Zarqun, and others. None achieved decisive victory; all struggled with the same problems of distance, supply, and ungovernable territory. The frequent turnover in command (some pashas ruled only months before being recalled, killed, or deposed by their own troops) reflected the occupation's instability. [P]

**Forces:**

**Musketeers:** The core advantage. Moroccan infantry armed with arquebuses could defeat any Songhai cavalry charge in open battle. The technology that had won Tondibi remained decisive whenever the resistance accepted pitched battle — which is why effective resistance increasingly avoided such engagements. [E]

**Cavalry:** A smaller component of the Moroccan force. Useful for pursuit and patrol but not the primary arm. [P]

**Artillery:** A few light cannon accompanied the original expedition. These had limited tactical value in the guerrilla warfare that followed Tondibi but were psychologically important in intimidating populations that had never seen such weapons. [P]

**Numbers:** The original expedition numbered approximately 4,000 combat troops. The Sahara crossing and the conquest itself caused significant casualties. By 1593, the effective strength was probably 2,500-3,000. Reinforcements arrived periodically, but the five-month desert crossing made reinforcement slow and costly. Meanwhile, casualties, disease, desertion, and natural attrition reduced the garrison. By 1600, the occupation force was probably 2,000 or fewer. [P]

**The Arma identity emerges:** From the beginning, the Moroccan soldiers began to put down roots in their conquered territory. They took local wives and concubines; their children were mixed Moroccan-African. The term *arma* (Arabic: "shooters," referring to their firearms) came to designate this hybrid population. Within a generation, the Arma were no longer Moroccan colonists but a local ruling class — still distinguished by their claim to Moroccan descent and their monopoly on firearms, but increasingly integrated into local society. [E]

**Strengths:**
- Firearms (muskets and artillery gave decisive advantage in pitched battle)
- Urban fortifications (control of Gao, Timbuktu, and Djenne provided secure bases)
- Professional military discipline (at least initially)
- Nominal support from Morocco (though this diminished rapidly after Ahmad al-Mansur's death in 1603)

**Weaknesses:**
- Distance (the Sahara crossing made reinforcement and communication with Marrakesh extremely difficult)
- Supply (food, ammunition, and replacement equipment all had to cross the desert or be obtained locally from hostile populations)
- Small numbers (never more than a few thousand soldiers trying to control a vast territory)
- Political instability (pashas rose and fell with remarkable frequency; the garrison eventually became effectively independent of Morocco)
- Disease (tropical and Sahelian diseases killed many soldiers unfamiliar with the local disease environment)

## The Campaign

### Phase 1: Immediate Aftermath of Tondibi (March 1591 - Late 1591)

**The collapse:**

The defeat at Tondibi shattered the Songhai field army but did not immediately end resistance. Askia Ishaq II fled the battlefield with surviving cavalry and retreated southward toward the Dendi region. Gao surrendered to Judar Pasha within days; the population, traumatized by news of the massacre, offered no resistance. Timbuktu followed, its scholars and merchants calculating that capitulation was preferable to assault. Djenne, the great trading city of the Inland Niger Delta, also submitted. [E]

**Judar's occupation:**

Judar Pasha occupied the captured cities and attempted to establish Moroccan administration. His primary interest — as mandated by Sultan Ahmad al-Mansur — was gold. Where was the gold? The Songhai had indeed been wealthy, but their wealth came from taxing the trans-Saharan gold trade, not from possessing gold reserves. The goldfields lay far to the south, in regions the Songhai had never directly controlled. The mines of Bambuk and Bure were accessible only through trade networks now disrupted by the invasion. Judar could find no mountains of treasure to ship back to Marrakesh. [E]

**The persistence of the Askia:**

Askia Ishaq II's survival gave the resistance a rallying point. From the Dendi region, he attempted to organize opposition, but his authority had been fatally damaged by his defeat. Within months, he was dead — murdered by his own followers according to one tradition, killed in a skirmish according to another. His death removed the specific individual who had failed at Tondibi but did not end the Askia institution. New claimants emerged. [E]

### Phase 2: The Rise of Askia Nuh (1591-1595)

**Askia Nuh's emergence:**

The most effective resistance leader was Askia Nuh, who established himself in the Dendi region by late 1591. Nuh was not a direct successor to Ishaq II but claimed the Askia title through his own lineage within the royal family. His legitimacy derived not from the discredited line of defeat but from his success in mounting effective resistance. [E]

**Dendi as base:**

The Dendi region — the southeastern portion of the old Songhai empire, along the Niger River south of Gao, extending into what is now Niger and Nigeria — became the territorial base of the Songhai resistance. This region offered several advantages:

- Distance from Moroccan-controlled cities
- Difficult terrain (river valleys, seasonal flooding) that hindered Moroccan cavalry and musket formations
- Loyal population (provincial officials and communities who had served the Askias and preferred Songhai rule)
- Access to resources (agricultural land, fishing, local trade networks)
- Gateway to southern regions beyond Moroccan reach

Dendi became, in effect, a Songhai government-in-exile, maintaining the institutions and titles of the old empire even as the heartland remained occupied. [E]

**Guerrilla warfare:**

Askia Nuh's strategy avoided the pitched battles that had destroyed the Songhai army at Tondibi. Instead, resistance forces employed guerrilla tactics:

- **Ambushes:** Moroccan supply columns moving between cities were attacked on the roads. Soldiers foraging outside city walls risked capture or death.
- **Raiding:** Resistance cavalry swept through territories nominally under Moroccan control, disrupting tax collection and demonstrating that the occupation's writ did not extend beyond the cities.
- **Interdiction of trade:** The trans-Saharan caravans that had enriched the Songhai state and were supposed to enrich the Moroccans became targets. Traders faced robbery or extortion by resistance forces who controlled the countryside.
- **Intelligence:** Local populations provided information about Moroccan movements, troop strengths, and vulnerabilities. The invaders operated in hostile territory where every villager was a potential informer for the resistance. [P]

**Major offensive (1594-1595):**

Askia Nuh mounted a major counteroffensive in 1594-1595 that came close to expelling the Moroccans. Resistance forces threatened Gao and Timbuktu; the Moroccan garrison found itself besieged within its urban fortifications. The campaign demonstrated that the occupation remained vulnerable despite its firepower advantage. [E]

**Death of Mahmud ibn Zarqun (1595):**

The high point of Nuh's resistance came with the killing of Pasha Mahmud ibn Zarqun in 1595. Mahmud, who had replaced Judar and had ordered the deportation of Timbuktu's scholars, was ambushed and killed by Songhai forces. The death of the Pasha demonstrated that even the highest-ranking Moroccans were not safe. It also created a leadership vacuum that the occupation struggled to fill. [E]

**The *Tarikh al-Sudan* records:**

> "Mahmud Zarqun went out to fight Askia Nuh, and he was killed in the year 1003 [1595 CE], and his army was scattered. This was a great blow to the Moroccans, for he was the strongest of their commanders, and after him they could not rest secure." [E]

### Phase 3: Continued Resistance and Moroccan Consolidation (1595-1599)

**Moroccan response:**

The death of Mahmud Zarqun prompted Morocco to renew its efforts. Reinforcements crossed the Sahara; new pashas were appointed. The occupation adopted more defensive postures, concentrating forces in the cities rather than pursuing the elusive resistance into the countryside. This conceded the hinterland to the Askia but preserved the Moroccan hold on the urban centers. [P]

**Stalemate:**

A military stalemate developed. The Moroccans could defend their cities against any assault the resistance could mount, but they could not pacify the countryside. Askia Nuh could harass the occupation indefinitely, but he could not recapture the cities with their Moroccan muskets and walls. Neither side could achieve decisive victory. [E]

**Economic warfare:**

The stalemate played out economically as well as militarily. The trans-Saharan trade that had motivated the Moroccan invasion was disrupted by the conquest itself and by the ongoing insecurity. Merchants avoided routes where they might be plundered by either side. The gold that Sultan Ahmad al-Mansur had coveted flowed in diminished quantities, when it flowed at all. The occupation was becoming a net cost rather than a source of revenue. [P]

**The Askia's court in exile:**

Throughout this period, Askia Nuh maintained a functioning court in the Dendi region. He appointed officials, collected taxes (from territories he controlled), dispensed justice, and preserved the forms of Songhai administration. This was not merely theatrical; it demonstrated that an alternative authority existed, that the Moroccan conquest was contested, and that subjects who remained loyal to the Askia had a legitimate government to support. [P]

### Phase 4: Death of Askia Nuh and Fragmentation (1599-1612)

**Askia Nuh's death (1599):**

The resistance's most effective leader died in 1599, reportedly from illness rather than battle. His death removed the one figure who had unified the Songhai resistance and maintained pressure on the occupation. No successor emerged with comparable authority. [E]

**Fragmentation:**

After Nuh's death, the resistance fragmented into competing factions:

- **Multiple Askias:** Several claimants asserted the title, each with his own followers. Askia al-Mustafa, Askia Muhammad Benkan, and others competed for supremacy among the Songhai remnant. Their rivalry weakened the resistance by dividing resources and attention.
- **Provincial autonomy:** Regional commanders who had cooperated with Askia Nuh pursued their own interests after his death. Some made local accommodations with the Moroccans; others continued resistance independently; still others carved out autonomous territories answering to no one.
- **Ethnic fragmentation:** The Songhai Empire had incorporated diverse peoples — Songhai proper, Soninke, Fulani, Tuareg, and others. The defeat and fragmentation weakened the bonds holding these groups together. Tuareg confederations in the north increasingly acted independently; Fulani communities pursued their own trajectories; the multi-ethnic coalition that had been Songhai splintered along its constituent lines. [P]

**Judar Pasha's return (1599):**

Sultan Ahmad al-Mansur sent Judar Pasha back across the Sahara in 1599, apparently hoping that the original conqueror could stabilize the faltering occupation. Judar's second expedition accomplished little. The resistance was fragmenting but not defeated; the occupation remained precarious; the gold continued to elude Moroccan grasp. Judar disappeared from the historical record after this expedition, dying (probably) in the early 1600s. [P]

**Continued violence (1599-1612):**

Sporadic fighting continued through the first decade of the 1600s. Moroccan forces conducted punitive expeditions against resistance strongholds; resistance fighters ambushed Moroccan patrols and raided occupied territory. But the intensity diminished. The unified resistance under Askia Nuh had become a collection of local insurgencies, none strong enough to threaten the occupation's existence but collectively sufficient to prevent pacification. [P]

**End of organized resistance (c. 1612):**

By approximately 1612, organized Songhai resistance had effectively ceased. This does not mean the Moroccans had "won" — they had not pacified the countryside, and their garrison remained vulnerable. Rather, the resistance had exhausted itself. The competing Askias no longer commanded significant forces; the provincial structures of the old empire had collapsed; the population, exhausted by two decades of war, accommodated itself to the new reality. The Songhai Empire was dead. [P]

### Decisive Factors

**Technology mismatch:**

The fundamental reality was that Songhai cavalry could not defeat Moroccan musketeers in pitched battle. This technological asymmetry, which had decided Tondibi, persisted throughout the resistance. Askia Nuh's guerrilla strategy was an adaptation to this reality — avoiding battles that could not be won — but it could not overcome it. The resistance could harass but not destroy the occupation. [E]

**Distance and logistics:**

The Moroccans' greatest weakness was distance. The five-month Sahara crossing made reinforcement slow and expensive. Supply lines stretched across the desert were vulnerable to disruption. Every soldier who died of disease, desertion, or combat was difficult to replace. Over time, the occupation force shrank to a fraction of its original strength. But the resistance could not exploit this weakness decisively; the cities remained defensible. [E]

**Political fragmentation:**

The Songhai resistance was ultimately defeated by its own internal divisions. The empire had been a political construction held together by the authority of the Askias; when that authority fragmented after Askia Nuh's death, the resistance fragmented with it. The Moroccans did not need to conquer every corner of the Songhai territory; they needed only to hold the cities and wait for the resistance to exhaust itself. [P]

**The Ahmad al-Mansur factor:**

Sultan Ahmad al-Mansur of Morocco, who had ordered the invasion, died in 1603. His death plunged Morocco itself into civil war among his sons, and the Moroccan state that had launched the conquest ceased to exist as a unified entity. The occupation of the Niger Bend became an orphan — a garrison far from home whose sponsor no longer existed. This severed the link to Marrakesh but did not immediately benefit the resistance; instead, it accelerated the Arma's transformation into an independent ruling class. [E]

## Aftermath

### Immediate Consequences

**Casualties:**

The two decades of resistance warfare killed thousands on both sides. Precise numbers are impossible to determine. The initial conquest at Tondibi killed several thousand Songhai soldiers. The subsequent guerrilla warfare claimed lives more slowly but steadily — ambushes, raids, punitive expeditions, disease, famine exacerbated by war. The civilian population suffered most: villages burned, crops destroyed, people displaced. The demographic impact was significant though unquantifiable. [S]

**Territorial outcome:**

The Moroccans held the cities — Gao, Timbuktu, Djenne — and their immediate environs. The countryside remained contested or autonomous. The Dendi region became the base of Songhai successor states that maintained independence from Moroccan/Arma control. The political map that emerged was fragmented: Arma-controlled city-states, Songhai remnants, Tuareg confederations, Fulani communities, independent towns, all pursuing their own interests in the absence of any overarching authority. [E]

**Economic disruption:**

The trans-Saharan trade, already damaged by the conquest, never recovered to its pre-war levels. The insecurity of the routes, the destruction of commercial infrastructure, the fragmentation of political authority — all contributed to a long-term decline in the volume and profitability of trade. Gold continued to flow, but in smaller quantities. The merchants who had made Timbuktu a commercial center dispersed to safer locations. The economic basis of Sahelian civilization was permanently diminished. [P]

### Long-Term Impact

**The Arma as a ruling class:**

The most enduring consequence of the conquest and resistance was the emergence of the Arma as a distinct ethnic and political community. The Moroccan soldiers who survived the conquest and the resistance married local women; their children were mixed. By the second generation (c. 1620s), the Arma were no longer Moroccans but a local ruling class distinguished by their claim to Moroccan descent, their control of firearms, and their dominance of the conquered cities. [E]

The Arma maintained nominal allegiance to Morocco but were effectively independent. They chose their own pashas (the title persisted); they managed their own affairs; they intermarried with local elites. Over time, they became fully integrated into the social fabric of the Middle Niger, speaking local languages, adopting local customs, and functioning as one ruling group among several in the region's complex political landscape. [E]

**Songhai successor states:**

The Songhai identity did not disappear with the empire. In the Dendi region, Songhai-identified political entities persisted, ruled by claimants to the Askia title. The Dendi kingdom maintained Songhai political traditions, language, and identity into the modern era. Other Songhai communities survived elsewhere in the former empire's territory. The destruction was political, not demographic; the Songhai people continued to exist even as their state fragmented. [E]

**Political fragmentation:**

The era of the great Sahelian empires — Ghana, Mali, Songhai — ended with the Moroccan conquest and the failure of the resistance. For the next two centuries, the Middle Niger was divided among competing polities: Arma pashalik centered on Timbuktu, Tuareg confederations, Fulani communities, various small states and independent towns. No single authority controlled the region until the nineteenth-century jihads created new state structures (the Sokoto Caliphate, the Toucouleur Empire, the Massina Empire) on different religious and political foundations. [E]

**Intellectual destruction:**

The Moroccan conquest and occupation inflicted lasting damage on the scholarly traditions of Timbuktu. The arrest and deportation of Ahmad Baba and other scholars in 1593 was only the most visible blow; the disruption of patronage, the looting of libraries, the dispersal of students and teachers all contributed to intellectual decline. Timbuktu remained a center of Islamic learning, but its golden age was over. The city that had rivaled Cairo and Fez as a center of scholarship became a provincial town, its reputation exceeding its diminished reality. [E]

### Treatment of the Defeated

**The Askias:**

The defeated Askias and their followers were treated differently depending on circumstances. Some were killed in battle or executed after capture. Others were allowed to survive in reduced circumstances, their claims to authority ignored but their lives spared. The Askias who established themselves in Dendi maintained their independence; those who fell into Moroccan hands were usually killed or neutralized. [P]

**The general population:**

The civilian population accommodated itself to the new reality over time. Those who lived in Moroccan-controlled cities paid taxes to the Arma and accepted their authority in practice, whatever they felt privately. Those in the countryside negotiated their own relationships with the various powers that claimed authority. The transition was not smooth — there was violence, displacement, impoverishment — but it was survivable. [P]

**The scholars:**

The scholarly community of Timbuktu survived, diminished. Ahmad Baba returned from Moroccan exile in 1608 and resumed teaching; other scholars who had fled or survived the occupation continued their work. The institutional structures that had supported scholarship — mosque-universities, libraries, patronage networks — were damaged but not destroyed entirely. The Arma rulers eventually patronized scholars themselves, recognizing the prestige that association with Timbuktu's learning conferred. But the scale and vitality of the pre-conquest scholarly world was not restored. [E]

## Military Analysis

### Tactics and Strategy

**Songhai guerrilla warfare:**

The Songhai resistance under Askia Nuh developed a sophisticated guerrilla strategy:

- **Avoid pitched battle:** The lesson of Tondibi was clear. Any engagement where Moroccan musketeers could form and fire would end in Songhai defeat. Therefore, the resistance avoided such engagements except when circumstances were exceptionally favorable.

- **Attack vulnerable points:** Supply columns, foraging parties, isolated outposts — these were the targets of resistance operations. Hit-and-run attacks that exploited Songhai mobility and local knowledge while minimizing exposure to Moroccan firepower.

- **Control the countryside:** By making the rural areas ungovernable, the resistance denied the Moroccans the agricultural surplus and trade revenue they needed to sustain the occupation. The cities could be held, but they could not prosper.

- **Preserve forces:** The resistance understood that survival was itself a form of victory. As long as the Askia and his army existed, the occupation remained contested. This patience was strategic, not defeatist. [P]

**Moroccan defensive consolidation:**

The Moroccans, for their part, adapted to the guerrilla challenge:

- **Urban concentration:** Forces were pulled back to the cities where they could be effectively defended. Attempts to control the countryside were abandoned as too costly.

- **Punitive expeditions:** Periodic campaigns against resistance strongholds demonstrated that the Moroccans could still project force, even if they could not hold territory. These expeditions aimed to kill resistance leaders, destroy supplies, and intimidate populations.

- **Divide and conquer:** The Moroccans exploited divisions among their enemies, making separate arrangements with Tuareg groups, Fulani communities, and others. The fragmentation of the resistance after Askia Nuh's death made this strategy increasingly effective.

- **Local integration:** Over time, the Moroccan garrison integrated with local society — marrying local women, adopting local customs, recruiting local allies. This process, which created the Arma identity, made the occupation more sustainable by reducing its dependence on Moroccan support. [P]

### Technology

**Firearms:**

The Moroccan technological advantage was firearms — arquebuses (heavy matchlock muskets) and, to a lesser extent, light artillery. These weapons had decided Tondibi and remained decisive throughout the resistance period. The Songhai never acquired firearms in significant numbers; their cavalry tactics were fundamentally incompatible with the new technology. The resistance could adapt by avoiding battles, but it could not match Moroccan firepower. [E]

**Horses:**

Both sides used horses, but for different purposes. The Songhai had built their empire on cavalry and continued to rely on mounted warriors for mobility, raiding, and reconnaissance. The Moroccans used cavalry primarily for pursuit and patrol; their decisive arm was infantry with firearms. The horse remained important, but its role in warfare had changed. [E]

**Fortifications:**

The cities that the Moroccans held — Gao, Timbuktu, Djenne — had walls that, combined with the firepower of the garrison, made them effectively impregnable to the resistance. The Moroccans also fortified outposts and camps. The resistance, operating in the countryside, made less use of fortifications, relying instead on mobility and the ability to disperse and reform. [P]

### Terrain and Environment

**The Niger River:**

The Niger River was the lifeline of the region — for transportation, communication, irrigation, and fishing. Control of the river and its floodplain was essential for both sides. The Moroccans held the major river cities; the resistance contested control of the waterway itself, attacking boats and disrupting river commerce.

**The Sahel margins:**

The transition zone between the Sahara Desert and the wetter savanna — the Sahel belt in which the Songhai Empire had flourished — provided the environmental context for the conflict. The Moroccans, coming from Morocco via the deep desert, were operating at the extreme limit of their logistical capacity. The resistance, by contrast, operated in familiar territory.

**Dendi:**

The southeastern region that became the resistance's base offered defensive advantages: distance from Moroccan-controlled cities, difficult terrain, access to resources beyond Moroccan reach. Dendi's remoteness, which had made it a peripheral province of the empire, became an asset for the resistance.

### Lessons

**Technological asymmetry can decide battles but not wars:**

Moroccan firearms won at Tondibi decisively, but the same technology could not pacify the countryside. The resistance demonstrated that guerrilla warfare can neutralize technological advantages by refusing to fight on the enemy's terms.

**Distance and logistics constrain conquest:**

The five-month Sahara crossing made the Moroccan occupation inherently fragile. Any conquest must be supported; when support is difficult, the conquest becomes vulnerable.

**Political legitimacy matters:**

The Askia title gave the resistance a rallying point. Even after military defeat, the persistence of legitimate authority sustained opposition. The Moroccans could kill individual Askias, but they could not eliminate the institution.

**Fragmentation follows imperial collapse:**

The Songhai Empire, like other empires, was a political construction. When that construction collapsed, the diverse peoples it had incorporated pursued their own interests. Unity against the invader was possible but difficult to sustain.

## Scholarly Debates

| Question | Position A | Position B | Current Consensus |
|----------|------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Duration of effective resistance** | Resistance remained significant until c. 1612 | Effective resistance ended with Askia Nuh's death (1599); after that, only scattered insurgency | [D] Both positions have merit; 1599-1612 was a period of declining but continuing resistance |
| **Could the resistance have succeeded?** | With better unity and leadership, the Moroccans might have been expelled | The technological asymmetry and urban control made Moroccan defeat impossible | [D] Speculative; most scholars consider Moroccan expulsion unlikely but not impossible before 1603 |
| **Role of Moroccan civil war (1603+)** | Morocco's internal collapse created an opportunity the resistance failed to exploit | By 1603, the resistance was too fragmented to exploit Moroccan weakness | [P] The Moroccan civil war benefited neither side decisively; the Arma became independent rather than defeated |
| **Askia Nuh's strategy** | Nuh's guerrilla approach was strategically sound and came close to success | Nuh's approach could harass but never defeat the occupation | [D] Nuh's strategy was effective given constraints; whether it could have achieved victory is debated |
| **When did the Arma become "local"?** | The Arma identity emerged within the first generation (by 1610s) | Full integration took longer (1620s-1640s) | [D] Process was gradual; dating depends on criteria used |

## For Fiction Writing

### Dramatic Potential

The Songhai resistance offers extraordinary material for historical fiction:

**The long defeat:** This is not a story of triumph but of defiance in the face of inevitable defeat. The resistance knew, at some level, that the old world was gone, that the technology that had shattered their army at Tondibi could not be wished away. Yet they fought for twenty years. This makes for tragedy on an epic scale — not the sharp blow of a single battle but the slow grinding down of a civilization.

**Askia Nuh as tragic hero:** The most effective resistance leader, who came closest to expelling the invaders, who maintained the structures of government and the hope of restoration, who died not in battle but of illness, leaving his cause to fragment after him. His story is one of doomed heroism — the leader who does everything right and still loses.

**The Arma transformation:** The Moroccan soldiers who crossed the Sahara to conquer became, over a generation, something else entirely — a local ruling class, neither Moroccan nor Songhai, forged in the crucible of conquest and resistance. This is a story of identity and adaptation, of how conquerors become part of the conquered landscape.

**The scholars and the soldiers:** Ahmad Baba, arrested in 1593 and exiled to Marrakesh, watching from afar as the resistance fought and failed. The tension between those who resisted with weapons and those who preserved what they could of learning and culture. The return to a diminished Timbuktu, trying to teach and write in the ruins of a destroyed intellectual world.

**The ordinary people:** Peasants, merchants, craftspeople trying to survive as empires rose and fell around them. The woman whose village was burned, the trader whose caravan was seized, the child growing up in wartime who knew no other world. These are the people who actually lived through the "long twilight" — their stories are the human texture of historical catastrophe.

### Sensory Details

**The Guerrilla Camp:**
- Hidden in the Dendi bush, perhaps a day's ride from the nearest Moroccan outpost
- Tents and shelters made of hides and woven mats, designed to be struck and moved in hours
- Horses picketed in lines, restless in the heat, flies buzzing around their ears
- The smell of cooking fires and horse sweat and the river nearby
- Men in dusty robes cleaning weapons, mending harness, playing board games to pass the time
- The sound of lookouts calling from treetops, of messengers arriving on lathered horses
- At night, the camp dark except for a few guarded fires, the sky brilliant with stars, the sounds of the bush — hyenas, night birds, the wind in the grass
- The tension of waiting — for orders, for attack, for news from the cities

**The Ambush:**
- A Moroccan supply column moving along the river road, camels laden with goods, soldiers walking in loose formation
- The resistance cavalry hidden in a dry riverbed, horses silent, men gripping weapons, waiting for the signal
- The moment of attack: war cries splitting the air, horses bursting from cover, the first shock of impact
- The Moroccans scrambling to form a firing line, the crack of muskets, smoke obscuring the scene
- The cavalry wheeling away before the volley can find its target, circling for another pass
- The Moroccans retreating toward their destination, the column in disarray, goods scattered
- The resistance riders gathering the spoils — captured weapons, food, perhaps a prisoner to interrogate
- The withdrawal before reinforcements can arrive, the ride back to camp with the day's take

**Occupied Timbuktu:**
- The great mosque of Djinguereber, its mud-brick walls and protruding wooden beams unchanged, but the atmosphere different — occupied, watched
- Moroccan soldiers in the streets, their clothing and accents foreign, their firearms always visible
- The book market diminished — fewer manuscripts, fewer buyers, the scholarly community scattered
- The house where Ahmad Baba once taught, now empty or occupied by strangers
- The Niger River flowing past the city as it always has, boats carrying goods, fishermen casting nets, life continuing despite everything
- The whispered conversations in courtyards, the careful navigation of occupation — cooperate enough to survive, resist enough to preserve dignity
- The call to prayer from the minarets, the same as it was before Tondibi, the one thing unchanged

**Askia Nuh's Court in Exile:**
- A camp that is also a capital, the forms of royalty maintained in reduced circumstances
- The Askia seated on his throne (perhaps a simpler one than his predecessors enjoyed, but a throne nonetheless)
- Courtiers and officials performing their offices, as if the empire still existed in full
- Petitioners presenting grievances, justice being dispensed, the machinery of government continuing
- The royal drums, the praise-singers reciting the Askia's lineage and victories
- Behind the ceremony, the military reality: war councils, reconnaissance reports, the constant calculation of forces and supplies
- The Askia himself: middle-aged perhaps, scarred from battle, carrying the weight of an impossible cause

**The Sahara Crossing (Moroccan reinforcements):**
- The endless dunes, the glare of sun on sand, the horizon shimmering with heat
- Camels loaded with supplies, soldiers trudging alongside or riding on exhausted mounts
- Thirst: the obsession with water, the rationing of the dwindling supply, the desperation as days pass between wells
- Men dying — of heat, of thirst, of exhaustion, their bodies left for the vultures
- The discipline breaking down as the march continues, soldiers cursing, deserting, dying
- The oases like miracles: green against the brown, water to drink and bathe in, shade to rest in
- The knowledge that the destination is more war, more hardship, a garrison surrounded by enemies
- Arriving at the Niger after months of suffering, seeing the river and the palm trees and the city walls, feeling something that might be relief or might be despair

### Character Moments

**Askia Nuh learning of Mahmud Zarqun's death:**

The messenger arrives at camp, dusty from hard riding. The Askia receives him in his tent, surrounded by his commanders. The man tells the story — the ambush, the pasha's death, the Moroccan rout. For a moment, there is silence. Then someone laughs, and suddenly everyone is laughing, shouting, embracing. The pasha who ordered the scholars arrested, who burned villages and enslaved children, is dead. Nuh does not laugh. He knows this changes nothing fundamental. The Moroccans will send another pasha, will continue the occupation. But for one moment, he allows himself to feel something like victory.

**A Moroccan soldier deciding to stay:**

The man is perhaps twenty-five, Spanish-born like Judar Pasha himself, captured as a child and raised Muslim. He has a wife now, a local woman who speaks no Arabic but communicates somehow. She is pregnant. The word comes that there will be no more reinforcements from Morocco — the sultan is dead, the empire is fighting itself, the garrison is on its own. The soldier looks at his wife, at the house they have built together, at the child growing in her belly. Morocco is a memory, a place he barely knows. This is his home now. He will fight if he must, but he will not cross the desert again.

**Ahmad Baba receiving news of the resistance in Marrakesh:**

The scholar is technically a prisoner, though he lives comfortably enough and teaches students who seek him out. A traveler from the Sudan brings news: Askia Nuh is still fighting, has killed a pasha, threatens the cities. Ahmad Baba absorbs this information in silence. What does he feel? Pride that his people resist? Grief that the war continues? Perhaps both. He remembers his library, scattered now across a thousand locations. He remembers his colleagues, dead or exiled or surviving somehow under occupation. He remembers Timbuktu. He cannot fight — he is a scholar, an old man in a foreign city — but he can remember, and record, and someday, perhaps, return.

**A village chief choosing sides:**

The chief is caught between powers. The Moroccans demand taxes and obedience; the resistance demands supplies and shelter. Both threaten destruction if denied. His village has survived the war so far by careful neutrality — paying what must be paid to whoever demands it, helping no one more than necessary. But now both sides are forcing the issue. The chief must choose, knowing that either choice may mean his village's destruction. He thinks of his grandchildren, of the crops in the fields, of the graves of his ancestors. What does he owe to the Askia, to the Moroccans, to his own people? What can he do that might let his village survive?

### Scene Opportunities

1. **The night before an ambush:** Askia Nuh briefs his commanders on the operation. The plan is laid out; roles are assigned; contingencies are discussed. Then, in the darkness before dawn, the riders move out toward the target.

2. **The failed assault on Timbuktu:** Resistance forces approach the city walls, hoping to find a weakness, to rally supporters within, to somehow break the occupation's grip. The attack fails — the walls are too strong, the muskets too deadly — and the survivors retreat, leaving their dead before the gates.

3. **A council of the fragmented resistance (post-1599):** Three different men claim the title of Askia. They meet, ostensibly to coordinate, actually to assert dominance over each other. The meeting dissolves in recrimination. The resistance that was unified under Nuh becomes three separate, weaker struggles.

4. **The Arma intermarriage scene:** A Moroccan officer takes a Songhai noblewoman as his wife. The ceremony blends traditions — Islamic vows, local customs, the two families eyeing each other warily. This union, multiplied hundreds of times, will create a new people.

5. **Ahmad Baba's return to Timbuktu (1608):** The scholar, released at last from Moroccan exile, approaches his home city for the first time in fifteen years. What does he see? The same buildings, the same mosques, the same Niger flowing past — but everything changed. His library gone, his colleagues dead or scattered, the city diminished. He enters the city gates a stranger in his own home.

6. **The last Songhai charge:** A cavalry attack on a Moroccan position, perhaps late in the resistance, perhaps futile. The riders know the odds; they charge anyway. Swords against muskets, courage against technology. The outcome is certain, but the defiance is real.

7. **A pasha's assassination:** A Moroccan commander, surrounded by guards, believing himself secure. The attack comes from within — a servant, a slave, someone who has been waiting for this moment. The pasha dies, and for a few hours, the Moroccans wonder if the resistance has penetrated their very households.

8. **The death of Askia Nuh:** Not in battle but in bed, from illness, surrounded by his followers. His last words (whatever they might be); the grief of his men; the immediate question: who will lead now? The moment when the unified resistance begins to fragment.

### Worldview and Values

**Songhai resistance worldview:**

- **Legitimacy of the Askia:** The rightful ruler of the Middle Niger was the Askia, the inheritor of the traditions established by Sunni Ali and Askia Muhammad I. The Moroccans were invaders with no right to rule.

- **Defense of Islam as practiced locally:** The Songhai were Muslims, but their Islam was their own — adapted to local conditions, practiced in local ways, taught by local scholars. The Moroccan claim to religious superiority was rejected. Ahmad Baba's scholarship was the equal of anything Marrakesh could offer.

- **Duty to resist:** Those who submitted to the invaders were collaborators; those who resisted were fulfilling their obligations to their ancestors, their faith, and their descendants.

- **Acceptance of loss:** The resistance knew, at some level, that the old world was gone. Fighting was not about restoring the past but about preserving what could be preserved — identity, honor, some fragment of independence.

**Arma worldview (emerging):**

- **Survival:** The garrison was far from home, surrounded by enemies, diminishing in numbers. Survival required adaptation — marrying local women, learning local ways, making local accommodations.

- **Military identity:** The Arma were defined by their firearms and their conquest. They were the rulers because they had conquered; their legitimacy derived from force, not tradition.

- **Hybrid identity:** Neither Moroccan nor Songhai, the Arma were creating something new. Their children would be African, raised by African mothers, speaking African languages, but maintaining the claim to Moroccan descent that justified their dominance.

- **Pragmatism:** The ideological motivations that had driven the invasion (gold, expansion of Sa'adi power) were increasingly irrelevant. What mattered was maintaining position, surviving, prospering if possible.

### Source Assessment

The Songhai resistance is well-documented by the standards of pre-modern African history. The *Tarikh al-Sudan* provides detailed narrative coverage; the *Tarikh al-Fattash* supplements it; Ahmad Baba's writings offer an eyewitness perspective from the scholarly community; Moroccan sources provide the conquerors' viewpoint. The main limitations are:

- **Bias:** The Timbuktu chronicles are hostile to the Moroccan conquest (justifiably) and favorable to the resistance. They should be read with awareness of this perspective.

- **Gaps:** The sources focus on leaders and major events; the experience of ordinary people during the resistance is largely unrecorded.

- **Dating:** Some specific dates are uncertain, particularly for events after 1600 when the chronicles become less detailed.

- **Fragmentation period:** The post-1599 fragmentation of the resistance is less well-documented than the earlier unified resistance under Askia Nuh.
