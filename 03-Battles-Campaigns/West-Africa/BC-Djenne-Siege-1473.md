## Overview

The Siege of Djenne stands as one of the great siege narratives of African military history. According to tradition, Sunni Ali Ber of Songhai invested the wealthy trading city for seven years, seven months, and seven days before its defenders finally capitulated — a formulaic number that nonetheless preserves memory of an extraordinarily prolonged campaign. Whether the siege lasted precisely this long or the duration has been compressed or expanded in oral transmission, the siege's reputation for exceptional length was already established when the *Tarikh al-Sudan* was compiled in the mid-seventeenth century.

Djenne was no ordinary prize. The city had risen to prominence as one of the premier trading centers of the western Sahel, positioned at the confluence of the Niger and Bani rivers in the Inland Niger Delta — a region of seasonal flooding that created both agricultural abundance and formidable natural defenses. During flood season, Djenne became an island accessible only by water, making direct assault virtually impossible. The city's reputation for impregnability was legendary; the *Tarikh al-Sudan* claims it had repelled ninety-nine previous sieges before Sunni Ali's campaign. Whether this number is historical or symbolic (ninety-nine being a number of completion in Islamic tradition, suggesting that Sunni Ali's siege was the hundredth and final one), Djenne's defensive strength was genuine and well-known.

The siege's ultimate success transformed the political landscape of the Middle Niger. With both Timbuktu (captured in 1468) and Djenne now under his control, Sunni Ali commanded the two most important commercial and intellectual centers of the western Sahel. The gold, salt, and kola nut trade that flowed through these cities enriched the Songhai treasury. Djenne's scholarly traditions, its skilled artisans, and its commercial networks now served Songhai's imperial interests. The city would flourish under Songhai rule, and its integration marked the moment when Songhai definitively surpassed the declining Mali Empire as the region's dominant power.

## Background and Causes

### Political Context

By the 1460s, the political order that had governed the western Sahel for two centuries was collapsing. The Mali Empire, which had dominated the region since Sundiata Keita's triumph at Kirina (c. 1235), had contracted to a shadow of its former self. Succession disputes, raids by the Mossi peoples from the south, and the loss of key provinces had reduced the once-mighty empire to its Mande heartland along the upper Niger. The power vacuum created opportunities for ambitious regional powers.

Songhai, centered on the city of Gao at the eastern bend of the Niger, had been a subordinate or vassal state of Mali for much of the previous two centuries. Under the Sonni (Za) dynasty, however, Songhai had been building strength and waiting for an opportunity. When Sunni Ali came to power in 1464, that opportunity had arrived.

Djenne, meanwhile, had maintained its independence throughout Mali's decline. The city-state owed no allegiance to any overlord. Its natural defenses, commercial wealth, and strategic importance made it a power in its own right — small in territory but significant in influence. Djenne's rulers had successfully defended their autonomy against all comers, building a reputation that deterred all but the most determined attackers.

### The City of Djenne

Djenne occupied one of the most strategically valuable positions in West Africa. Located in the Inland Niger Delta — the vast seasonal floodplain where the Niger River spreads into a network of channels, lakes, and marshes — the city controlled the point where goods from the forest zone to the south (gold, kola nuts, enslaved people) met goods from the Sahel and Sahara to the north (salt, cloth, horses, manufactured items).

The city's origins are debated. The nearby site of Jenne-Jeno (Old Djenne), excavated by Roderick and Susan McIntosh, demonstrates that urban settlement in the area dates back to at least the third century BCE, making it one of the oldest urban sites in sub-Saharan Africa. The relationship between ancient Jenne-Jeno and the medieval Islamic city of Djenne is complex — they coexisted for centuries, with Djenne gradually growing as Jenne-Jeno declined. By Sunni Ali's time, Djenne was the preeminent settlement in the delta, a walled city of mud-brick architecture that would later inspire the famous Great Mosque.

Beyond its commercial importance, Djenne was a significant center of Islamic learning. While Timbuktu would eventually eclipse it in scholarly reputation, Djenne's madrasas and scholars were well-respected throughout the western Sahel. The city's intellectual and commercial elites were deeply interconnected, with wealthy merchant families patronizing religious learning and scholarship conferring social prestige.

### Immediate Cause

The *Tarikh al-Sudan* does not specify a particular casus belli for Sunni Ali's attack on Djenne. The broader strategic logic, however, is clear. Having captured Timbuktu from its Tuareg occupiers in 1468, Sunni Ali controlled the northern terminus of the Niger's navigable reaches but not its commercial heartland. Djenne, positioned to control the southern trade networks that fed Timbuktu's markets, was the natural next target. Without Djenne, Sunni Ali's hold on the Middle Niger would remain incomplete.

It is possible that Djenne had supported the Tuareg or refused to acknowledge Songhai supremacy after Timbuktu's fall. The sources are silent on this point. What is clear is that Sunni Ali, having committed himself to building an empire along the Niger, could not leave Djenne independent on his flank.

### Strategic Objectives

**Songhai Objectives:**
- Gain control of Djenne's commercial wealth and its position in the trans-Saharan and forest-savanna trade networks
- Eliminate an independent power that could threaten Songhai's nascent empire
- Complete dominance of the Middle Niger, controlling both Timbuktu (northern terminus) and Djenne (southern trade hub)
- Demonstrate Songhai military power to other polities that might resist incorporation

**Djenne's Objectives:**
- Preserve the city's independence and its citizens' lives and property
- Outlast the besiegers, hoping Songhai forces would eventually withdraw due to logistical strain, disease, or political distraction
- Maintain the city's reputation for impregnability, which served as a deterrent against future attacks

## The Belligerents

### Songhai Forces

**Commander:** [[West-Africa/Songhai-Empire/HF-Sunni-Ali]] (Sunni Ali Ber, Sonni Ali, "Sunni Ali the Great")

Sunni Ali was the quintessential warrior-king of the Sahelian tradition. The *Tarikh al-Sudan*, despite its hostility toward him, acknowledges his military brilliance: "He was always victorious and never suffered defeat." His twenty-eight-year reign (1464-1492) was characterized by nearly continuous campaigning — against the Tuareg, the Mossi, the Fulani, the Dogon, and the remnants of Mali, as well as Djenne. He combined personal bravery with strategic patience, as the Djenne siege demonstrates.

**Forces:**

The Songhai army that besieged Djenne comprised several elements: [S]

*Infantry:* Songhai infantry included both professional warriors (*ton-den*, a term borrowed from the Mande tradition) and levied troops from conquered territories. They carried iron-tipped spears, swords, and shields. Some units may have included archers.

*Cavalry:* Horses, acquired through the trans-Saharan trade, gave Sahel empires their striking power. Songhai cavalry wore quilted cotton armor that provided some protection against arrows and slashing weapons. Cavalry dominated open-field battles but were of limited use against fortified cities, particularly those surrounded by water.

*River Fleet:* The most distinctive element of Songhai military power. The Niger River served as both highway and highway for the empire, and Songhai maintained a significant fleet of war canoes. These vessels — large dugout canoes capable of carrying dozens of warriors — could transport troops rapidly along the river system and, crucially, control water approaches to island or riverine cities like Djenne. The *Tarikh al-Sudan* mentions specific naval commanders, indicating the fleet's institutional importance.

*Estimated Numbers:* No reliable figures exist for the Songhai forces at Djenne. Given the siege's duration and the logistical challenges of maintaining an army in the field for years, the besieging force likely varied significantly over time, with a core of professional warriors supplemented by rotating levies.

**Strengths:**
- Unified command under a determined and skilled ruler
- Control of the Niger River and its approaches
- Ability to sustain a prolonged campaign through control of surrounding agricultural territory
- Djenne's isolation from potential allies

**Weaknesses:**
- Inability to directly assault the city during flood season
- Logistical strain of maintaining siege lines for years
- Potential for disease, desertion, and morale problems during the extended campaign
- Other enemies (Tuareg, Mossi) who might strike while Songhai forces were committed to the siege

### Djenne Forces

**Commander:** Unknown

The *Tarikh al-Sudan* does not name the ruler(s) of Djenne during the siege. This is characteristic of the chronicles' focus on the great empires (Mali, Songhai) rather than smaller polities. The city would have been governed by a king or chief (the title varies in sources) with authority over military matters, supported by a council of merchant and scholarly elites.

**Forces:**

*City Militia:* Djenne's defenders would have included a core of professional warriors and a militia drawn from the city's male population. In a siege, merchants, artisans, and scholars might all be called upon to man the walls.

*Naval Forces:* Djenne maintained its own fleet of canoes for commerce and defense. During flood season, these vessels were essential for maintaining contact with the outside world, bringing in supplies, and repelling Songhai naval attacks.

*Estimated Numbers:* Unknown. Djenne was a significant city, possibly with a population in the tens of thousands during its peak. The number of combatants would have been a fraction of this.

**Strengths:**
- Formidable natural defenses (surrounded by water during flood season)
- Strong mud-brick walls and fortifications
- Reputation for successful resistance (the "99 sieges" tradition)
- Knowledge of local terrain and waterways
- Interior position allowing defense from all directions

**Weaknesses:**
- No possibility of external relief — Djenne stood alone
- Limited agricultural territory; dependent on trade for food
- Prolonged siege would exhaust stored supplies
- Civilian population (women, children, elderly) creating additional mouths to feed

## The Siege

### The Djenne Environment

Understanding the siege requires understanding the Inland Niger Delta's unique hydrology.

The Niger River enters the delta from the southwest, where it is joined by the Bani River near modern-day Mopti. Within the delta, the rivers spread into a maze of channels, lakes, and marshes covering approximately 30,000 square kilometers during the annual flood. The flood cycle follows the monsoon rains, with waters rising from August through November and receding from January through June. During the flood, the landscape transforms into an inland sea dotted with islands — the elevated ground where settlements cluster.

Djenne sits on such an island, elevated sufficiently to remain above the highest flood levels. During flood season (roughly August-December), the city was accessible only by boat. Direct assault was virtually impossible: attackers would have to approach across open water under fire from the walls, then somehow scale fortifications while wading in chest-deep water. During the dry season, the waters receded, and land approaches became possible — but Djenne's walls still presented a formidable obstacle, and the surrounding terrain remained marshy and difficult.

This environment dictated the siege's character. Sunni Ali could not simply storm the city. He had to isolate it, cut its supply lines, and wait for hunger to accomplish what direct assault could not.

### Approach and Investment

The siege likely began shortly after Sunni Ali's capture of Timbuktu in 1468, though the exact starting date is uncertain. The *Tarikh al-Sudan*'s seven-year duration, if taken literally, would place the siege's beginning around 1466 (before Timbuktu's fall) or its end around 1475-1476. Most modern scholars place the siege in the years immediately following Timbuktu's capture, roughly 1469-1473 or 1468-1475.

Sunni Ali's initial approach would have involved:

**Securing the surrounding region:** Before investing Djenne itself, Songhai forces would have needed to control the delta's approaches, neutralizing any settlements that might support the city and securing food supplies for the besieging army.

**Establishing naval superiority:** The Songhai fleet was essential for controlling access to Djenne. War canoes would have patrolled the rivers and channels, intercepting supply boats and preventing Djenne's merchants from conducting trade.

**Building siege lines:** During the dry season, Songhai forces could approach closer to the city's walls, constructing camps and fortifications to maintain the blockade year-round.

### The Blockade Strategy

Sunni Ali's strategy was essentially one of starvation. With direct assault impractical, the siege became a test of endurance: could Djenne outlast the Songhai blockade, or would hunger force submission first?

The blockade operated on multiple levels:

**Trade interdiction:** Djenne's wealth depended on trade. Cut off from its commercial networks, the city could neither sell its goods nor import necessities. Merchants who attempted to run the blockade faced Songhai canoes. The economic devastation may have been as significant as the food shortage.

**Agricultural isolation:** The delta's rich fisheries and flood-retreat agriculture normally supported Djenne's population. With Songhai forces controlling the surrounding waters and lands, these food sources were no longer accessible.

**Psychological pressure:** Year after year of siege, with no relief in sight, would have eroded the defenders' morale. Sunni Ali's reputation for victory — and for harsh treatment of those who resisted too long — would have loomed large in Djenne's calculations.

### Life Under Siege

The *Tarikh al-Sudan* provides a glimpse of conditions within the besieged city:

> "The siege continued until the people of Djenne were reduced to eating carrion and the hides of animals."

This terse description suggests the typical progression of a prolonged siege: first the consumption of stored grain and livestock, then the slaughter of working animals (horses, donkeys), then the consumption of anything remotely edible — including leather, which can be boiled to extract minimal nutrition.

Famine would have been accompanied by disease. Crowded conditions, compromised sanitation, and malnutrition create ideal conditions for epidemic illness. While the chronicles do not mention plague or pestilence at Djenne, such outbreaks were common in siege conditions.

The social fabric would have frayed under these pressures. Who received the diminishing food supplies? Did the wealthy eat while the poor starved, or did communal solidarity prevail? Were there factions within the city advocating surrender, and if so, how were they suppressed? The sources are silent on these questions, but any prolonged siege produces such tensions.

### Skirmishes and Assaults

While the siege was primarily a blockade, it would have included periodic military action:

**Naval engagements:** Songhai and Djenne canoes would have clashed repeatedly, particularly during attempts by Djenne vessels to break through the blockade for supplies or communication.

**Dry-season probes:** When the waters receded, Songhai forces could approach the walls more closely. Assaults or probing attacks during these periods would have tested the defenses, even if they fell short of full-scale storming.

**Sorties:** Djenne's defenders may have attempted sorties — sudden attacks from the city to disrupt the siege lines, capture supplies, or simply demonstrate continued fighting spirit.

None of these actions proved decisive. The siege remained a grinding war of attrition.

### The Decisive Moment: Submission

After years of suffering, Djenne's leaders chose surrender over death. The *Tarikh al-Sudan* describes the conclusion:

The city submitted through negotiation rather than falling to assault. The terms were apparently generous — remarkably so, given the siege's length and Sunni Ali's reputation for harshness. Several elements characterized the surrender:

**Preservation of the city:** Djenne was not sacked or destroyed. Its population was spared massacre, and its physical infrastructure remained intact.

**Marriage alliance:** Sunni Ali reportedly married a princess of Djenne's ruling family, incorporating the local elite into Songhai's political structure through kinship rather than simple conquest.

**Administrative incorporation:** Djenne became part of the Songhai Empire, subject to Songhai authority and taxation, but maintaining its commercial functions and (apparently) much of its local governance.

Why such lenient terms after such a prolonged resistance? Several factors may explain Sunni Ali's approach:

1. **Economic calculation:** Djenne's value lay in its commercial networks and skilled population. A devastated city would have been worthless; a functioning city, merely under new management, continued to generate wealth.

2. **Respect for resistance:** The Sahelian warrior tradition honored courage, even in enemies. Djenne's years of resistance may have earned a respect that collaboration would not have.

3. **Propaganda value:** The contrast between Djenne's treatment (submission = survival) and potential alternatives (resistance = destruction) sent a message to other cities contemplating their response to Songhai expansion.

4. **Source bias:** The *Tarikh al-Sudan*, compiled by scholars who were themselves integrated into the Songhai-descended establishment, may have understated any violence to present the Songhai conquest in favorable terms.

## Aftermath

### Immediate Consequences

**For Djenne:**
The city survived the siege diminished but intact. Its population had suffered years of famine and privation, with unknown mortality. Its trade networks had been disrupted. Yet the essential elements of Djenne's prosperity — its location, its skilled merchants and artisans, its scholarly traditions — remained. Under Songhai rule, the city would rebuild and eventually flourish.

**For Songhai:**
The siege's successful conclusion completed Sunni Ali's strategic vision for the Middle Niger. With both Timbuktu and Djenne under his control, he dominated the region's commerce and could project power in any direction. The fall of Djenne also demonstrated Songhai's implacable determination — if even this legendarily impregnable city could be reduced, what hope did lesser powers have?

**For the Region:**
Djenne's fall effectively ended any prospect of a power other than Songhai dominating the western Sahel. Mali, already weakened, lost any realistic chance of reversing its decline. The Tuareg, driven from Timbuktu, could only raid from the desert margins. The commercial networks that had operated independently of any imperial structure were now firmly under Songhai's regulatory control.

### Long-Term Impact

**The Songhai Empire:**
Djenne's incorporation strengthened Songhai economically and strategically. The city's tribute and taxes enriched the imperial treasury. Its position allowed Songhai to tap into the gold and kola trade from the forest zone to the south. When Askia Muhammad I later reformed Songhai's administration, Djenne became one of the empire's key provincial centers.

**Djenne's Golden Age:**
Paradoxically, the conquest inaugurated Djenne's greatest era. Under the Pax Songhaica, the city's commerce flourished as never before, protected by imperial power and connected to the empire's vast network. Djenne's scholarly traditions continued to develop, producing jurists and theologians respected throughout the Islamic world. The architectural tradition that would later create the Great Mosque (rebuilt in its current form in 1907, but based on earlier structures) reached new heights.

**The Great Mosque:**
While the present Great Mosque of Djenne postdates our period, the tradition of grand mosque-building in Djenne extends back to the city's incorporation into Songhai. The city's identity as an Islamic center — a "city of 4,444 saints," according to local tradition — was reinforced under Songhai rule. Sunni Ali's conquest, ironically, strengthened the Islamic scholarly establishment that his treatment of Timbuktu's scholars had threatened.

### Treatment of the Defeated

Unlike his reportedly harsh treatment of Timbuktu's scholars, Sunni Ali's approach to Djenne was conciliatory:

- The ruling family was not eliminated but integrated through marriage
- No mass executions or deportations are recorded
- The city's institutions — commercial, scholarly, administrative — continued to function
- Djenne's identity as a distinct community within the empire was preserved

This differential treatment has puzzled historians. Some suggest it reflects Sunni Ali's pragmatism — Timbuktu's scholars had collaborated with the Tuareg enemy and deserved punishment, while Djenne had simply defended itself honorably. Others note that Djenne's submission through negotiation allowed for terms that assault would have precluded. Still others suspect that the sources (written by Timbuktu scholars) exaggerate the contrast, inflating Sunni Ali's harshness toward Timbuktu while accepting Djenne's account of lenient treatment.

## Military Analysis

### Tactics and Strategy

**Sunni Ali's Strategy:**

The siege exemplifies the strategic patience that characterized Sunni Ali's greatest campaigns. Facing an enemy he could not defeat through direct assault, he chose to outlast rather than overwhelm. This required:

- **Long-term thinking:** Committing to a siege of unknown duration, potentially years
- **Resource management:** Maintaining an army in the field while not exhausting the surrounding region
- **Political discipline:** Keeping his army loyal and focused despite monotony and hardship
- **Strategic flexibility:** Conducting other operations while the siege continued (the sources suggest Sunni Ali campaigned elsewhere during the Djenne siege, leaving forces to maintain the blockade)

**Djenne's Strategy:**

The defenders pursued the only viable option available to them:

- **Defense in depth:** Relying on natural and artificial fortifications
- **Endurance:** Stretching resources to outlast the besiegers
- **Hope for relief:** Whether through Songhai exhaustion, distraction by other enemies, or divine intervention

The strategy failed not because it was flawed but because Sunni Ali's determination exceeded Djenne's capacity to endure.

### Technology

**Fortifications:**

Djenne's walls were constructed of *banco* — sun-dried mud brick, the building material of the Sahel. While not as durable as stone, banco walls could be quite substantial (several meters thick at the base) and were adequate against the weapons of the period. More importantly, they could be repaired relatively easily after damage. The walls were strengthened by the city's island position, which functioned as a massive natural moat during flood season.

**Naval Technology:**

Both sides relied on the war canoe — large dugouts carved from single tree trunks, capable of carrying dozens of warriors. These vessels were paddled, not sailed, making them maneuverable in the narrow channels of the delta. Canoes could be equipped with awnings for protection and carried archers whose elevated position gave them advantages against swimmers or waders.

**Weapons:**

Standard Sahel-region weapons: iron-tipped spears and javelins for infantry, swords and daggers for close combat, bows and arrows for ranged engagement. Cavalry (of limited use in the siege itself) carried lances and swords, with quilted cotton armor for protection.

### Terrain and Environment

The Inland Niger Delta's hydrology was the decisive factor in the siege's character. The seasonal flood cycle created windows of opportunity and impossibility:

- **Flood season (August-December):** Assault impossible; naval operations predominant; blockade maintained by canoe patrols
- **Dry season (January-July):** Land operations possible but terrain remained difficult; walls could be approached but remained formidable

The delta's fertility was both blessing and curse. Normally it supported Djenne's population; under siege, that population was cut off from the agricultural lands that sustained it. The same waters that protected Djenne from assault also imprisoned its people.

Climate added its challenges. The Sahel's hot season (March-June) brought punishing heat that sapped besiegers and besieged alike. The rainy season brought mosquitoes and malaria, potentially deadly to armies in the field. Any prolonged military operation in the delta required accounting for these environmental factors.

### Lessons

**For military history:**

The Siege of Djenne demonstrates several enduring principles:

1. **Natural defenses can delay but not prevent determined attack:** Djenne's island position prolonged the siege but could not win the war.

2. **Logistics determine siege outcomes:** Neither side could achieve a quick decision; victory went to whoever could sustain their effort longer.

3. **Strategic patience has costs:** Sunni Ali committed years to the Djenne campaign — years during which other enemies might have struck.

4. **Naval power matters on inland waters:** The Niger River fleet gave Songhai a decisive advantage; without it, the siege might have been impossible.

5. **Negotiated surrender preserves value:** A sacked Djenne would have been worthless; an integrated Djenne enriched the empire.

**For African military history:**

The siege challenges assumptions about pre-modern African warfare. It demonstrates sophisticated operational thinking, sustained strategic commitment, and complex logistics — capabilities sometimes denied to African polities in older historiography. Sunni Ali's campaign was not a raid or a single decisive battle but a years-long strategic operation requiring coordination, supply, and persistence.

## Scholarly Debates

| Question | Position A | Position B | Current Consensus |
|----------|------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Duration of the siege** | Seven years (traditional) — the *Tarikh al-Sudan*'s figure is approximately accurate | The "seven years, seven months, seven days" formula is symbolic; actual duration was shorter, perhaps 2-4 years | [D] Debated; the siege was prolonged, but exact duration uncertain |
| **Chronology** | Siege began c. 1468-1469, immediately after Timbuktu's capture, ending c. 1473-1475 | Various alternative datings place the siege slightly earlier or later | [P] Most scholars accept c. 1469-1473/76 |
| **"99 sieges" tradition** | Djenne had genuinely resisted numerous previous attacks, making Sunni Ali's success remarkable | The number is symbolic/formulaic; it emphasizes Djenne's impregnability rather than recording actual sieges | [D] The city's defensive reputation was genuine; the specific number is likely symbolic |
| **Sunni Ali's treatment of Djenne vs. Timbuktu** | Different circumstances justified different treatment (collaboration vs. honorable resistance) | The sources (Timbuktu scholars) exaggerate the contrast to vilify Sunni Ali regarding Timbuktu | [D] Some difference in treatment likely occurred; sources may exaggerate |
| **The marriage alliance** | Sunni Ali married a Djenne princess as part of surrender terms | The marriage tradition may be later rationalization of the city's integration | [P] Generally accepted, though details uncertain |
| **Economic vs. military factors in surrender** | Famine and exhaustion forced submission | Diplomatic negotiations and guarantees of favorable treatment were equally important | [P] Both factors likely contributed |

## For Fiction Writing

### Dramatic Potential

**Fiction Potential: VERY HIGH**

The Siege of Djenne offers exceptional material for historical fiction:

**Epic Scale:** A seven-year siege is the stuff of Homeric legend. The prolonged nature creates space for character development, shifting fortunes, and the slow grind of attrition that tests all participants.

**The Island City:** Djenne rising from the floodwaters is a visually stunning setting — a city seemingly floating on an inland sea, its mud-brick walls and towers reflected in the surrounding waters, accessible only by boat. This is a fantasy-novel setting that actually existed.

**The Invincible Made Vincible:** Djenne's legendary impregnability (99 sieges resisted!) creates high stakes. Watching the "invincible" city slowly succumb — knowing the outcome but following the process — generates tragic tension.

**The Conqueror and the City:** Sunni Ali — brilliant, ruthless, controversial, possibly practicing forbidden religion — besieging a city of merchants and scholars represents multiple layers of conflict: military, economic, religious, cultural.

**Moral Complexity:** Neither side is simply hero or villain. Djenne's defenders are protecting their homes; Sunni Ali is building an empire that will bring stability and prosperity. The siege's suffering falls on ordinary people caught between competing visions.

**The Aftermath:** Sunni Ali's surprising mercy — the marriage alliance, the city's preservation — offers a resolution that subverts expectations. Why? What passed between conqueror and conquered in those final negotiations?

### Sensory Details

**Sight:**

*The city from the water:*
Djenne rising from the floodwaters — massive mud-brick walls the color of wet sand, towers and minarets catching the morning sun, the whole city floating like a mirage on the silver expanse of the flooded delta. During dry season, the walls loom above cracked mudflats where canoes lie beached like stranded fish.

*The siege lines:*
Songhai encampments ringing the distant city — cook-fires visible at night like a necklace of stars, the dark hulls of war canoes drawn up on the shore, the flutter of banners marking the commanders' positions.

*Inside the city:*
Streets growing quieter as the siege drags on. Markets where nothing is sold. The faces of the starving — children with distended bellies, elders too weak to rise. The Great Mosque (or its predecessor) where the faithful pray for deliverance.

*Combat scenes:*
War canoes slicing through the channels, paddle-spray catching the light, archers loosing arrows across the water. Dry-season skirmishes at the walls — ladders thrown up against the fortifications, defenders pushing them back with spears and stones.

**Sound:**

*The siege:*
The constant splash of paddles from Songhai patrol boats. The call to prayer from Djenne's minarets, increasingly desperate as hope fades. The wail of mourners — funerals that never cease as hunger claims its toll.

*Combat:*
War drums carrying across the water. War cries in Songhai and in Djenne's tongue. The crack of arrows striking shields, the thud of bodies falling into the river, the screams of the wounded.

*The city under siege:*
Children crying from hunger. Arguments over the last scraps of food. The eerie silence of markets that should be bustling. At night, the prayers of the devout and the weeping of the despairing.

**Smell:**

*The delta:*
Rich, organic smell of the floodwaters — mud, decaying vegetation, fish. Smoke from cooking fires mixing with the humid air. During dry season, the sharper smell of dust and sun-baked earth.

*The siege:*
Smoke from Songhai camps drifting across the water. Inside Djenne, the smell of the starving — a distinctive sweetness of bodies consuming themselves. The reek of improper sanitation as the siege stretches on. Blood and corruption from the unburied dead.

*The final days:*
Leather boiling in desperate pots. The acrid smell of hides being prepared for eating. Incense burning in the mosque — the last reserves consumed in prayer for salvation.

**Touch/Feel:**

*The climate:*
The crushing heat of the hot season — air thick enough to chew, sweat that never dries. The relative relief of the flood season, when the waters bring coolness but also mosquitoes that leave welts on every exposed surface. The grit of Saharan dust during the harmattan wind.

*Siege conditions:*
The rough texture of mud-brick walls beneath defenders' hands. The smooth wood of a canoe gunwale. The weight of a spear, growing heavier as hunger saps strength. The weakness in limbs that have not had proper food for months.

*Combat:*
Water churning around a canoe in battle. The shock of an arrow impact against a shield. The frantic scramble up a siege ladder, hands slipping on sun-heated mud brick.

**Taste:**

*Before the siege:*
The rich flavors of delta cuisine — fresh fish from the Niger, millet porridge, stews flavored with imported spices from the trans-Saharan trade. The sweetness of dates. The bitter-bright taste of kola nut that keeps traders alert through long negotiations.

*During the siege:*
First the blandness of rationed food, then the monotony, then the desperation. Boiled leather — chewy, flavorless, barely nutritious. Leaves and roots that would never be eaten in normal times. The metallic taste of starvation itself.

*For the besiegers:*
Better than the besieged, but still the campaign diet — dried fish, millet, whatever game can be hunted. The taste of river water, silty and warm. The luxury of captured supplies from a successful skirmish.

### Character Moments

**The Defiant Ruler:**
Djenne's unnamed king or chief, watching from the walls as Songhai canoes complete yet another patrol. Years into the siege, face gaunt with shared privation, still refusing to surrender. "We have held through ninety-nine sieges. We will hold through the hundredth." But in private moments — doubt, desperation, the weight of every death he has caused by continuing to resist.

**The Starving Child:**
A child of Djenne, seven years old when the siege began (one year for each year of the siege — symmetry the oral tradition would appreciate), growing up knowing nothing but hunger and fear. His entire experience of the world shaped by the siege. What does he remember of the city's glory? What will he become in its aftermath?

**The Patient Conqueror:**
Sunni Ali receiving reports from the siege lines, year after year. Other campaigns call — the Mossi are raiding, the Tuareg are restless — but always he returns his attention to Djenne. "The city will fall. I have only to wait." But does even he doubt, in the fourth year, the fifth? What sustains his certainty?

**The Negotiator:**
A merchant of Djenne, perhaps, sent to Sunni Ali's camp to discuss terms. Walking through the enemy encampment, seeing the strength that has hemmed his city for years. The negotiations — what is offered, what is demanded, what is agreed. The moment of surrender itself.

**The Bride:**
The princess of Djenne, whose marriage to Sunni Ali seals the peace. What does she think, this woman whose body becomes the treaty? Does she hate her new husband? Does she eventually find respect, even affection? Her children will be heirs to the conqueror — and to the conquered.

### Before the Battle

**Preparations:**
Songhai forces gathering at Gao before the campaign. The loading of war canoes — weapons, supplies, the personal effects of men who may not return. Sunni Ali's generals receiving their orders: "Djenne will be ours. However long it takes."

**Rituals:**
The religious dimension is complex. Sunni Ali, described by the chronicles as practicing indigenous religion alongside nominal Islam, might have consulted diviners and made sacrifices before the campaign. Within Djenne, the Islamic scholarly establishment would have led prayers for the city's defense. Both sides invoking divine favor for their cause.

**Intelligence:**
What did Sunni Ali know about Djenne's defenses, its food supplies, its political divisions? The sources are silent, but any competent commander would have sought such information. Merchants who had traded with Djenne, refugees from earlier conflicts, perhaps even agents within the city walls.

**The Mood:**
In the Songhai camp — confidence, perhaps, but tempered by Djenne's reputation. They are about to attempt what ninety-nine others have failed to achieve. In Djenne — fear, but also pride in their city's legendary strength. They have held before. They will hold again.

### During the Siege

**The Daily Rhythm:**
Patrol boats circling the city. Defenders watching from the walls. The monotony of siege warfare — long stretches of tedium punctuated by moments of violence. The slow grinding down of Djenne's reserves, invisible but relentless.

**Key Scenes:**

*A naval engagement:*
Djenne canoes attempting to break through the blockade — perhaps carrying sick civilians to seek food, or attempting to smuggle in supplies. Songhai war canoes intercepting, arrows flying across the water, the boarding action and its bloody conclusion.

*A dry-season assault:*
Songhai forces probing Djenne's walls when the floods recede. Ladders against the mud brick, defenders hurling spears and stones from above. The assault fails — it was never meant to succeed, only to test, to weary, to remind the defenders that their enemy remains.

*Inside the city:*
A council of Djenne's leaders debating surrender. The merchants who see their wealth destroyed, the scholars who fear Sunni Ali's reputation, the warriors who refuse to yield. Voices raised, accusations traded, no resolution reached.

*A private moment:*
Two ordinary people within Djenne — a husband and wife, perhaps, or a parent and child — sharing the last of the food. The intimacy of desperation. The decision that someone must eat and someone must go hungry. Love and sacrifice in the midst of disaster.

**The Turning Point:**
When does Djenne decide to surrender? Perhaps a particular death — a respected leader finally succumbing to hunger — breaks the will to resist. Perhaps a realization that the coming flood season will not bring relief, only another cycle of the same suffering. Perhaps a Songhai offer that arrives at precisely the right psychological moment.

### After the Siege

**The Entry:**
Sunni Ali entering Djenne — through gates opened willingly, not breached by force. What does he see? A city of ghosts, its streets half-empty, its survivors barely able to stand. What does he feel? Triumph? Pity? The cold satisfaction of calculation fulfilled?

**The Wedding:**
The marriage between conqueror and Djenne princess. An event freighted with political meaning — but also a human moment. What passed between them on that first night? The chronicles do not say; fiction may imagine.

**The Rebuilding:**
Djenne slowly returning to life under Songhai rule. Merchants resuming trade, now under new regulations. Scholars reopening their schools, adjusting to a new political reality. The survivors finding their place in a transformed world.

**The Memory:**
Generations later, griots telling the tale of the siege — how Djenne held for seven years, how Sunni Ali's patience finally prevailed, how the city was spared by the conqueror's mercy. The siege becoming legend, its suffering transformed into story, its survivors becoming ancestors.

### Dialogue Opportunities

**Sunni Ali to his generals:**
"Djenne has resisted ninety-nine times. Let them resist the hundredth. I am not ninety-nine fools; I am Sunni Ali. I will take what I have sworn to take."

**A Djenne elder to the council:**
"How many more must die before we accept what cannot be changed? Our walls are strong, but they cannot be eaten. Our reputation is glorious, but glory does not feed children."

**The negotiation:**
Djenne's emissary: "What does the Sunni offer if we open our gates?"
Sunni Ali: "Life. The same trade you have always conducted. A princess of your house to share my throne. What more could Djenne want?"
Emissary: "Our freedom."
Sunni Ali: "That you spent seven years ago, when you chose to resist me. Now I offer something else: survival."

**The princess:**
To Sunni Ali: "You have taken my city. You have taken my body. What else would you have?"
Sunni Ali: "Your counsel. Your city knows the delta as I do not. Your people will serve me better if their princess tells them to."

## Sources

### Primary Sources

**Tarikh al-Sudan (Abd al-Rahman al-Sadi, c. 1650):**
The principal source for the siege. Al-Sadi provides the "seven years, seven months, seven days" tradition and the claim of ninety-nine previous sieges. Writing approximately 180 years after the events, he drew on oral tradition, institutional memory, and possibly earlier written sources now lost. His Timbuktu perspective may have colored his account of Sunni Ali's campaigns, but he provides the most detailed narrative available.

**Translation:** John Hunwick, *Timbuktu and the Songhay Empire: Al-Sa'di's Ta'rikh al-Sudan down to 1613, and Other Contemporary Documents* (Brill, 1999). [E — essential primary source]

**Tarikh al-Fattash (Mahmud Kati family, c. 1519-1665):**
Provides complementary information on Sunni Ali's campaigns, including brief references to Djenne. The text's complex transmission history — portions written by Mahmud Kati in the early sixteenth century, with additions by his descendants over generations — makes it difficult to date specific passages. Shares the Timbuktu scholarly perspective with the *Tarikh al-Sudan*.

[E — important primary source with textual complexities]

### Secondary Sources

**Hunwick, John O., *Timbuktu and the Songhay Empire* (1999):**
The standard scholarly translation of the *Tarikh al-Sudan* with extensive historical analysis. Hunwick's introduction and notes provide the most authoritative treatment of Songhai history, including the Djenne campaign.

**Gomez, Michael A., *African Dominion: A New History of Empire in Early and Medieval West Africa* (2018):**
The most recent major synthesis. Gomez provides fresh analysis of Sunni Ali and the Djenne siege, engaging with questions of source bias and placing the campaign in broader context.

**McIntosh, Roderick J., *Ancient Middle Niger: Urbanism and the Self-Organizing Landscape* (2005):**
Essential for understanding Djenne's environmental and archaeological context. McIntosh's excavations at Jenne-Jeno and analysis of delta settlement patterns illuminate the city's position and defenses.

**Levtzion, Nehemia, *Ancient Ghana and Mali* (1973):**
Provides context for the decline of Mali and the rise of Songhai, situating the Djenne campaign in the broader transformation of Sahelian political geography.

**Cissoko, Sekene Mody, *Tombouctou et l'Empire Songhay* (1975):**
French-language study offering a Malian scholarly perspective on Songhai history, including the Djenne siege.

### Source Assessment

The evidence for the Siege of Djenne is thin but consistent. The *Tarikh al-Sudan* provides our primary narrative, and its account is generally accepted by modern scholars as reflecting genuine tradition about a historical event. However, several cautions apply:

**The seven-year duration:** The formulaic nature of "seven years, seven months, seven days" suggests possible stylization. Ancient and medieval sources frequently round siege durations to significant numbers. The siege was certainly prolonged — this is agreed — but the precise duration cannot be verified.

**The ninety-nine sieges:** Almost certainly a literary device rather than historical count. The number emphasizes Djenne's impregnability and magnifies Sunni Ali's achievement in succeeding where all others failed.

**Lack of Djenne perspective:** Our sources are written from the Timbuktu scholarly tradition, which had its own relationship with Songhai power. Djenne's own memory of the siege, transmitted through its own institutions, is not independently preserved.

**What is established [E]:**
- Sunni Ali conducted a significant military operation against Djenne
- The siege was prolonged (multiple years)
- Djenne eventually submitted and was incorporated into the Songhai Empire
- The city was treated relatively leniently after submission

**What is probable [P]:**
- The siege occurred in the years following Timbuktu's capture (c. 1468-1476)
- Sunni Ali employed naval blockade as his primary strategy
- A marriage alliance was part of the peace settlement

**What is traditional/oral [T]:**
- The seven-year duration
- The "99 sieges" tradition
- Specific details of suffering within the city
- The precise terms of surrender
