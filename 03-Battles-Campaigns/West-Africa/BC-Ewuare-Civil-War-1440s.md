## Overview

The succession crisis, civil war, and subsequent conquest campaigns collectively known as "Ewuare's War" represent one of the most consequential series of conflicts in West African history. What began as a dynastic struggle among the sons of Oba Ohen descended into fratricidal violence that devastated Benin City, only to culminate in the emergence of a transformative ruler who would rebuild the kingdom on a scale unprecedented in the forest zone.

The conflict unfolded in distinct phases. First came the succession crisis following Oba Ohen's death, in which Ewuare — then known by his birth name, reportedly Ogun — was passed over for the throne and driven into exile. Second came the fratricidal war between his brothers Uwaifiokun and Ogun (a different brother bearing this name), which destroyed much of Benin City and left the kingdom in chaos. Third came Ewuare's return from exile, his seizure of power over the ruins of his brothers' conflict, and his consolidation of authority against any remaining opposition. Fourth and finally came the expansion campaigns, in which Ewuare extended Benin's power over neighboring peoples, incorporating their territories and populations into a vastly enlarged kingdom.

The name "Ewuare" itself — meaning "the trouble has ceased" in the Edo language — commemorates this passage through catastrophe to renewal. It is a name of transformation, marking the moment when a hunted prince became a conquering king and a ruined city became the foundation for one of West Africa's most magnificent urban centers. The conflict's aftermath included the construction of the great earthwork walls around Benin City, the reorganization of the political system to strengthen the Oba's authority, the patronage of the bronze-casting guilds that would produce some of Africa's most celebrated artworks, and the establishment of new rituals and festivals — including the igue ceremony commemorating the dead of the civil war. Ewuare's War was not merely a succession conflict; it was the crucible in which the Benin Kingdom was remade.

## Background and Causes

### Political Context

The Kingdom of Benin in the early fifteenth century was a significant but not yet dominant power in the West African forest zone. The Benin royal dynasty traced its origins to the Oranmiyan tradition, which held that the current line had been founded by a prince from Ife — the sacred city of the Yoruba — who was invited to rule Benin during an earlier era of political crisis. This foundation narrative served to establish the royal family's distinctiveness from and elevation above the indigenous Edo aristocracy, particularly the powerful hereditary chiefs known as the Uzama Nihinron or "Kingmakers." [P]

The relationship between the Oba and the Uzama was the central tension in Benin politics. The Uzama held their positions by hereditary right; they had traditionally exercised significant influence over the selection of new rulers and the conduct of royal policy. The Obas, in turn, sought to expand their authority and reduce their dependence on these entrenched aristocratic interests. This structural tension shaped the dynamics of every succession and created the conditions in which disputed successions could escalate into violent conflict. [P]

Oba Ohen (or Ehen), who reigned approximately from 1400 to the late 1430s, faced significant challenges to his authority. The precise nature of these challenges is unclear in the oral traditions, but the period before Ewuare's reign was remembered as one of political instability and contested royal power. When Ohen died, he left multiple sons with competing claims to the throne — and a political system in which the mechanisms for managing such competition were insufficient to prevent catastrophe. [T]

### The Succession Crisis

According to oral tradition compiled by Jacob Egharevba and other Benin court historians, the succession after Oba Ohen's death descended rapidly into conflict. The tradition names three principal figures among Ohen's sons: Uwaifiokun, Ogun, and the future Ewuare (whose birth name is variously recorded, sometimes as Ogun as well, creating confusion with his brother of the same name). The traditions are not entirely consistent about the sequence of events, but they agree on the essential pattern: Ewuare was passed over for the throne, forced into exile, and his brothers subsequently destroyed each other in civil war. [T]

Why was Ewuare passed over? The traditions offer various explanations. Some versions suggest that the Uzama chiefs preferred candidates they believed would be more pliable, selecting Ewuare's brothers over the strong-willed prince who would later prove so capable of centralizing power. Other versions imply that Ewuare had somehow fallen from favor — through a transgression, a political miscalculation, or simple bad fortune in the factional maneuvering that accompanied every succession. The uncertainty reflects the limitations of oral tradition as a historical source: the narrative logic of the exile-and-return pattern may have shaped the telling, and the specific reasons for Ewuare's initial exclusion may have been simplified or lost over centuries of transmission. [T]

What is consistent across all versions is that Ewuare's exclusion was not peaceful. He was forced from Benin City and spent years wandering in exile before he could return. The succession had become violent from the start, setting the stage for the worse violence to follow.

### Strategic Objectives

**For Uwaifiokun and Ogun (the brothers):** Each sought to secure the throne for himself and eliminate rival claimants. In a system where succession was contested, the existence of multiple royal brothers with potential claims represented a permanent threat to whichever brother managed to take power. Neither was willing to accept subordination to the other.

**For the Uzama chiefs:** The hereditary aristocracy likely sought to exploit the succession crisis to enhance their own influence, backing whichever candidate they believed would best serve their interests or playing candidates against each other to weaken royal authority. The civil war that resulted was, in part, a failure of the Uzama to manage the succession effectively.

**For Ewuare (in exile):** Survival first, then return. The traditions describe Ewuare spending years in the forest, building strength and gathering followers. His objective was to reclaim the throne that he believed was rightfully his — and to do so in a way that would prevent any future repetition of the chaos that had driven him out.

**For neighboring peoples:** The civil war in Benin represented both danger and opportunity. The weakening of the Benin state might make them vulnerable to raids, but it also created the possibility of greater independence from Benin's influence. Some may have harbored refugees from the conflict; others may have waited to see which way the struggle would turn before committing themselves.

## The Belligerents

### Phase 1: The Fratricidal War

#### Uwaifiokun's Faction

**Commander:** Prince Uwaifiokun, son of Oba Ohen

**Forces:**
- Composition: Palace guard units loyal to Uwaifiokun; warriors from chiefs allied with his faction; possibly conscripted commoners
- Estimated numbers: Unknown [S] — the traditions describe devastating warfare but provide no numerical estimates
- Equipment: Standard Benin infantry armament — iron swords, spears, bows, crossbows; no cavalry (horses could not survive in the forest zone)
- Support: Portions of the Uzama aristocracy who backed his claim

**Strengths:** Initial legitimacy as the reigning or designated heir; access to palace resources; support from established political factions

**Weaknesses:** Rival brother with equal claim and comparable support; inability to achieve decisive victory

#### Ogun's Faction (the brother)

**Commander:** Prince Ogun, son of Oba Ohen (not to be confused with Ewuare, who may have shared this birth name)

**Forces:**
- Composition: Similar to Uwaifiokun — personal retainers, allied chiefs' warriors, conscripts
- Estimated numbers: Unknown [S]
- Equipment: Standard Benin infantry armament
- Support: Rival faction among the Uzama and palace associations

**Strengths:** Comparable legitimacy and resources to Uwaifiokun

**Weaknesses:** Symmetry of the conflict — neither brother could achieve decisive advantage

### Phase 2: Ewuare's Return

#### Ewuare's Force

**Commander:** Prince Ewuare (returning from exile)

**Forces:**
- Composition: Personal followers accumulated during exile; warriors from communities that had sheltered him; possibly disaffected elements from Benin who joined him as he approached
- Estimated numbers: Unknown [S] — traditions suggest he did not return with a massive army but rather exploited the exhaustion of the civil war
- Equipment: Standard forest-zone infantry weapons
- Logistics: Dependent on allies and supporters along his route of return

**Strengths:**
- The civil war had exhausted his brothers' factions
- Fresh forces entering a conflict between tired, depleted opponents
- Possible legitimacy as the surviving adult male of the royal line
- Years of exile had forged personal resilience and tactical experience
- May have had supernatural reputation (traditions credit him with knowledge of medicine and magic)

**Weaknesses:**
- Returning from outside; uncertain reception
- Smaller initial force than the established factions
- Had to rebuild political support from a position of weakness

#### Remaining Opposition

**Commanders:** Surviving supporters of the dead brothers; independent chiefs who resisted Ewuare's consolidation

**Forces:** Depleted remnants of the civil war factions; local defensive forces

**Strengths:** Established local positions; some fortified settlements

**Weaknesses:** Exhausted by civil war; fragmented leadership; unable to coordinate against Ewuare

### Phase 3: Expansion Campaigns

#### Ewuare's Army (consolidated)

**Commander:** Oba Ewuare Ogidigan

**Forces:**
- Composition: Reorganized Benin military under direct royal command; warriors from newly created titled positions loyal to the Oba; conscripted labor-soldiers from the kingdom's population
- Estimated numbers: Sufficient to conduct sustained campaigns over years; large enough to besiege and take fortified towns
- Equipment: Iron weapons (swords, spears, daggers); bows and crossbows (the forest zone crossbow was a significant weapon); possibly poison-tipped arrows; no cavalry
- Logistics: Organized supply system supporting extended campaigns; mobilization of conquered populations for subsequent campaigns

**Strengths:**
- Unified command under a capable, battle-tested ruler
- Reorganized political system directing resources toward military expansion
- Reputation for victory attracting followers
- Forest terrain favoring defenders — Ewuare understood how to take towns in this environment

**Weaknesses:**
- Forest warfare was slow and difficult
- Each fortified town required separate reduction
- Extended campaigns strained the kingdom's resources

#### Neighboring Peoples

**Commanders:** Various — local chiefs, town councils, regional rulers

**Forces:**
- Composition: Local militias; some specialized warrior groups; defensive positions
- Equipment: Similar to Benin forces — iron weapons, bows, fortifications
- Defensive advantages: Dense forest limited mobility; fortified settlements with walls and ditches

**Strengths:** Local knowledge of terrain; fortified positions; desperation of defense

**Weaknesses:** Fragmented; unable to coordinate against Benin's sustained pressure; individually weaker than the Benin state

## The War: Phases and Progression

### Phase 1: Exile and Fratricidal Conflict (c. 1438-1443) [T]

#### Ewuare's Expulsion

The exact circumstances of Ewuare's expulsion from Benin City are unclear in the traditions. Some versions suggest he fled to avoid assassination; others that he was formally exiled after a political defeat in the succession struggle. What is consistent is that he spent years away from the capital, living in reduced circumstances that later traditions described in terms meant to emphasize the depth of his fall and the magnitude of his eventual restoration. [T]

The traditions describe Ewuare wandering through the forest zone, at times living in desperate poverty, at times finding shelter with communities that recognized his royal blood. He reportedly worked as a laborer, experienced hunger and hardship, and learned to survive by his wits and his will. The exile served a narrative function — demonstrating the hero's resilience and establishing that legitimate power cannot be permanently suppressed — but it may also reflect historical reality. Succession struggles in African kingdoms frequently ended with defeated princes fleeing into exile, and some eventually returned to claim power. [T]

During Ewuare's absence, his brothers Uwaifiokun and Ogun escalated their conflict. What had begun as political rivalry became military confrontation. Each brother commanded supporters among the chiefs and palace associations; each believed he had the stronger claim; neither would yield.

#### The Brothers' War

The civil war between Uwaifiokun and Ogun devastated Benin City. Buildings were destroyed; the palace compound was damaged; much of the urban population fled or was killed. The traditions describe the conflict in terms of its destructive totality — this was not a limited political struggle but a cataclysm that unmade the orderly world of the Benin Kingdom. [T]

The exact sequence of the fighting is not preserved. What the traditions consistently report is the outcome: both brothers died. Some versions say they killed each other in battle or through assassination; others say one killed the other and was then killed by Ewuare upon his return. The uncertainty reflects the limitations of the sources, but the essential fact — that the fratricidal conflict ended with both principals dead — is the consistent element that made Ewuare's return possible. [T]

The war lasted an uncertain period, perhaps several years. By its end, Benin City lay in ruins, the kingdom's administration had collapsed, and the way was open for whoever could impose order on the chaos.

### Phase 2: Ewuare's Return and Seizure of Power (c. 1443-1445) [T]

#### The Decision to Return

At some point during his exile, Ewuare learned of the war between his brothers and its destructive course. The traditions suggest that news of the brothers' deaths — or of the chaos that made their destruction inevitable — prompted his return. He gathered whatever followers he had accumulated in exile and began moving toward Benin City. [T]

The return journey was itself a military operation. Ewuare could not simply walk back into the capital; he had to build support, recruit warriors, and demonstrate that he was capable of restoring order. Communities that had sheltered him during his exile now provided the nucleus of his force. Disaffected elements from Benin — those who had suffered from the civil war or who saw opportunity in backing a fresh claimant — may have joined him as he approached. [T]

#### Entry into Benin City

Ewuare entered Benin City either as a conqueror or as a restorer — the distinction depended on who was left to oppose him. With both brothers dead, his claim to the throne as the surviving adult male of the royal line was strong. But there would still have been remnants of his brothers' factions, chiefs who had benefited from the chaos, and opportunists who had carved out positions of power during the interregnum. [T]

The traditions describe Ewuare imposing his authority through a combination of force and political skill. He was not merely victorious in battle; he was capable of building coalitions, rewarding supporters, and eliminating or neutralizing opponents. The political reforms he later implemented — creating new titles dependent on royal favor, reorganizing the palace associations — may have begun during this consolidation phase, as Ewuare sought to ensure that no coalition of chiefs could ever again threaten to repeat the catastrophe of his brothers' war. [P]

#### The Name Change

Upon his accession, the new Oba adopted the name "Ewuare" — "the trouble has ceased." This was not merely a personal name but a programmatic statement, a declaration that the era of chaos was over and a new order was beginning. Some traditions also credit Ewuare with adding "Oba" to the royal title, transforming the ruler's designation to emphasize sacred and political weight beyond what previous rulers had claimed. [T]

The name change marked a break with the past. The prince who had been driven into exile was symbolically dead; in his place stood a new figure, defined by his role as the one who ended the troubles and would rebuild what had been destroyed.

### Phase 3: Consolidation and Internal Campaigns (c. 1445-1450) [T]

#### Eliminating Opposition

Ewuare's consolidation required dealing with any remaining threats within the Benin polity. This meant:

- Eliminating or neutralizing supporters of his dead brothers
- Asserting authority over chiefs who had become too independent during the civil war
- Bringing outlying areas of the kingdom back under central control
- Demonstrating through military success that the new Oba was capable of defending and extending the kingdom

The traditions mention various military actions during this period, though without specific details. Some may have been punitive expeditions against chiefs who resisted the new order; others may have been campaigns to recover territories that had drifted away from Benin's control during the interregnum. [T]

#### Political Reorganization

Simultaneously with military consolidation, Ewuare began the political reforms that would reshape the Benin state. He created new titled positions directly dependent on the Oba — positions that were not hereditary but granted and revocable by royal will. This created a class of officials whose power derived entirely from their relationship with Ewuare personally, counterbalancing the established hereditary chiefs (the Uzama Nihinron) whose independence had contributed to the succession crisis. [P]

The palace associations (ekakole) were reorganized and expanded. These associations, staffed increasingly by commoners and palace servants rather than hereditary nobles, became instruments of royal administration that allowed Ewuare to govern without depending on the cooperation of potentially hostile aristocrats. [P]

These reforms were not merely administrative; they were a response to the civil war. Ewuare had seen what happened when the checks on royal brothers and aristocratic factions failed. His political reorganization was designed to ensure that no such catastrophe could recur — concentrating power in the Oba's hands so thoroughly that no rival could accumulate the resources to mount a serious challenge. [P]

### Phase 4: Expansion Campaigns (c. 1450-1473) [T]

#### Strategic Objectives

With internal consolidation achieved, Ewuare turned to expansion. The traditions credit him with conquering over 200 towns and villages — a figure that may be exaggerated but indicates the scale of his military ambitions. The expansion served multiple purposes:

- **Resource extraction:** Conquered territories provided tribute, labor, and trade goods
- **Captives:** Warfare provided prisoners, some of whom became agricultural and craft workers within Benin, while others entered the regional trade networks
- **Military prestige:** Successful conquest reinforced the Oba's domestic position and attracted followers
- **Strategic depth:** Expanding the kingdom's boundaries pushed potential threats further from the capital
- **Reunification:** Some campaigns may have been reconquests of territories that had traditionally been under Benin influence but had drifted away during the civil war

#### Military Methods

Benin's military organization was infantry-based, suited to the forest zone environment. The army included:

- **Professional warriors:** Men whose primary occupation was fighting, organized into units under royal command
- **Conscripted soldiers:** Commoners mobilized for specific campaigns, serving their military obligation as a form of tribute
- **Specialists:** Crossbowmen, archers, possibly poison-specialists (some forest-zone armies used poisoned weapons)
- **Siege capabilities:** Engineers and laborers capable of reducing fortified settlements

The forest terrain shaped tactics. Unlike the cavalry charges of the Sahel empires, Benin's warfare involved moving through dense vegetation, approaching fortified towns through cleared agricultural zones, and conducting sieges against settlements protected by walls and ditches. Ambush was a constant danger; forest paths could become killing grounds. [P]

Ewuare's campaigns were not a single continuous operation but a series of expeditions over years, gradually extending Benin's territory in multiple directions. Each conquered town was incorporated into the kingdom's administrative structure — its leaders replaced or subordinated to Benin-appointed officials, its population liable for tribute and labor service.

#### Documented Campaigns

The oral traditions mention specific campaigns without providing tactical details:

- **Eastern expansion:** Campaigns against Edo-speaking communities to the east, incorporating them into the kingdom
- **Western expansion:** Conflicts with Yoruba-influenced areas to the west, defining the boundary between Benin and Yoruba spheres of influence
- **Niger Delta:** Extension of influence toward the coast and the waterways, which would become increasingly important for trade
- **Northern expansion:** Limited by the forest-savanna boundary and the presence of other powers [T]

The total claimed conquest of "201 towns and villages" appears in the oral traditions. Even if exaggerated, it indicates sustained military activity over years, with campaigns launched regularly during the dry season when movement through the forest was easier. [T]

## Aftermath

### Immediate Consequences

#### Human Cost

The civil war phase of the conflict caused heavy casualties among the population of Benin City. Buildings were destroyed, families scattered, and normal life disrupted for years. The expansion campaigns that followed added to the death toll, both among Benin's soldiers and among the populations of conquered territories. [T]

The traditions do not provide casualty figures, but the scale of destruction — requiring massive reconstruction of the capital — indicates that the losses were substantial. This was not a limited succession struggle but a catastrophic civil war followed by decades of external warfare.

#### Political Transformation

Ewuare's victory resulted in the most thoroughgoing centralization of power in Benin's history. The political reforms he implemented — new titles, reorganized palace associations, strengthened Oba authority — created a system in which the ruler's power was far less constrained than it had been before the civil war. The hereditary chiefs retained their positions but found their influence counterbalanced by new officials who owed everything to the Oba. [P]

This political structure would persist for centuries, creating the stable and centralized kingdom that Portuguese visitors encountered in the 1480s. The very success of Ewuare's reforms can be measured by their longevity: the system he established outlasted not only his own reign but the entire pre-colonial period, remaining in place until the British destruction of Benin in 1897.

#### Territorial Expansion

The expansion campaigns significantly enlarged the Kingdom of Benin. The exact boundaries are uncertain, but Ewuare's conquests established Benin as the dominant power in the forest zone between the Yoruba kingdoms to the west and the Niger Delta peoples to the east and south. Tributary relationships linked numerous formerly independent communities to the Benin state. [P]

### Long-Term Impact

#### The Rebuilding of Benin City

The most visible consequence of Ewuare's War was the reconstruction of Benin City on a monumental scale. The capital that emerged from the rebuilding was not merely a repaired version of the pre-war city but a fundamentally transformed urban center — larger, more organized, and protected by massive earthwork walls. [E]

The wall system that Ewuare initiated (though extended by successors over centuries) represented one of the largest pre-mechanical earthwork construction projects in human history. Deep moats fronted massive earth walls reaching heights of up to 20 meters in some sections. The walls enclosed the city and extended outward to define the boundaries of Benin's core territory, eventually totaling over 16,000 kilometers in aggregate length. [E]

Within the walls, the city was reorganized. The palace compound was expanded and elaborated. Roads were widened and straightened. Occupational guilds were assigned specific quarters. The city that emerged was planned and ordered — a physical manifestation of the political order Ewuare had imposed on the chaos of civil war. [P]

#### The Bronze-Casting Tradition

Ewuare's patronage of the bronze-casting guilds elevated an already sophisticated artistic tradition to new heights. The lost-wax casting technique, possibly derived from contact with Ife, was employed to create commemorative heads, relief plaques, regalia, and ritual objects that served the needs of the transformed court. [P]

The bronzes were not merely decorative but served political and religious functions. Commemorative heads placed on ancestral altars connected the living Oba to his predecessors. Relief plaques mounted on palace pillars created a visual chronicle of Benin's history and royal power. Ritual objects embodied spiritual force. The artistic tradition Ewuare patronized would continue producing masterworks for four centuries after his death. [E]

#### The Igue Festival

Among the most significant cultural consequences of Ewuare's War was the institution of the igue festival. According to tradition, this annual ceremony was established to commemorate the dead of the civil war and to celebrate the restoration of order under Ewuare. The festival involved elaborate rituals conducted by the Oba, offerings to the spirits of the dead, and public ceremonies that reinforced the kingdom's political and spiritual unity. [T]

The igue festival represented Ewuare's recognition that the violence of the civil war could not simply be forgotten. The dead — including his own brothers and their followers — required commemoration. By institutionalizing their remembrance in an annual ritual, Ewuare transformed the trauma of the civil war into a recurring affirmation of the order that had emerged from chaos.

#### The Tragedy of the Sons

The ultimate tragedy of Ewuare's reign was the death of both his sons in an epidemic, probably plague or smallpox, that swept the kingdom toward the end of his life. After a reign marked by triumph — military victory, political consolidation, architectural achievement, artistic patronage — Ewuare lost the heirs who would have continued his dynasty. [T]

His response was extraordinary: a period of kingdom-wide mourning during which sexual intercourse, drumming, and bathing were prohibited throughout Benin. The entire kingdom was to share in the Oba's grief, transforming private loss into public ritual. More permanently, Ewuare abolished the title of Edaiken (crown prince), leaving it vacant as a perpetual commemoration of his lost sons. [T]

This final element of Ewuare's story — the king who achieved everything only to lose what mattered most — adds a tragic dimension to what might otherwise be a straightforward narrative of triumph. The succession after Ewuare's death was troubled, with uncertain candidates and political instability, precisely because the great ruler had been unable to secure the dynasty he had fought so hard to establish.

### Treatment of the Defeated

The traditions provide limited information about the treatment of those defeated in Ewuare's wars. Some patterns can be inferred:

**Domestic opponents:** Supporters of the dead brothers faced various fates depending on their degree of opposition and their potential usefulness to the new regime. Some were probably executed; others were dispossessed of positions and property; still others were co-opted into the new order through grants of office or marriage alliances. Complete elimination of the defeated was neither practical nor necessary — Ewuare needed administrators and warriors, and many former opponents could serve if properly controlled. [S]

**Conquered peoples:** The expansion campaigns produced captives, some of whom were incorporated into Benin's economy as agricultural workers, craft producers, and servants. Others entered the regional trade networks that connected the forest zone to the broader West African economy. The conquered territories were incorporated into Benin's administrative system, with their populations becoming subject to tribute and labor obligations. [P]

## Military Analysis

### Tactics and Strategy

#### Civil War Phase

The civil war between Uwaifiokun and Ogun appears to have been characterized by:

- **Urban warfare:** Fighting within and around Benin City, resulting in extensive destruction
- **Factional conflict:** Each side drawing on networks of chiefs and retainers rather than standing armies
- **Attritional dynamics:** Neither side could achieve decisive victory, leading to prolonged fighting
- **Escalation:** What may have begun as political rivalry became total war

The failure of either brother to prevail quickly suggests relatively balanced forces and capabilities. In such circumstances, the conflict could only end through mutual exhaustion — which is apparently what happened, creating the opening for Ewuare's return.

#### Ewuare's Return

Ewuare's successful seizure of power combined military and political elements:

- **Timing:** Returning when his brothers had exhausted each other
- **Legitimacy:** As the surviving adult male of the royal line, he had a strong claim
- **Fresh forces:** His followers had not been depleted by the civil war
- **Political skill:** Building coalitions, winning over waverers, isolating irreconcilables

The traditions suggest that Ewuare did not have to fight a major battle to take power — the civil war had already done the work of eliminating his rivals. His task was consolidation rather than conquest.

#### Expansion Campaigns

The expansion campaigns that followed consolidation employed forest warfare tactics suited to the environment:

- **Systematic reduction:** Taking one fortified town at a time
- **Siege warfare:** Isolating and reducing defended settlements through blockade and assault
- **Forest movement:** Moving troops through dense vegetation, maintaining supply lines
- **Incorporation:** Not merely defeating but absorbing conquered territories into the Benin administrative system

The sustained nature of the expansion — conducted over years, with multiple campaigns — indicates a strategy of gradual absorption rather than rapid conquest. Each new acquisition had to be consolidated before the next campaign could be safely launched.

### Technology

#### Weapons

Benin's infantry forces employed:

- **Iron swords:** Both long cutting swords and shorter stabbing weapons
- **Spears:** For thrusting and throwing
- **Bows and crossbows:** The forest-zone crossbow was a significant weapon, capable of firing heavy bolts with considerable force; some traditions mention poison-tipped projectiles
- **Daggers and knives:** For close combat
- **Shields:** Probably wicker or hide, for protection against arrows and blows

The Benin military was technologically similar to other forest-zone forces. Advantages came from organization, leadership, and numbers rather than superior weapons.

#### Fortifications

Both defensive and offensive aspects of Benin warfare involved fortifications:

- **Defensive:** Towns protected by walls (earthwork or wooden palisade) and ditches; Benin City itself surrounded by massive earthworks
- **Offensive:** Capabilities for conducting siege warfare — blocking gates, scaling or undermining walls, cutting off supplies

The massive walls Ewuare constructed around Benin City were both military and symbolic — they protected the capital but also demonstrated the mobilization capacity of the state and the grandeur of the ruler.

### Terrain and Environment

The forest zone fundamentally shaped military operations:

- **Dense vegetation:** Limited visibility and movement; favored ambush and defense
- **No cavalry:** Horses could not survive in the tsetse-fly-infested forest (unlike the Sahel, where cavalry was decisive)
- **Wet and dry seasons:** Campaigns conducted during the dry season when movement was easier; the rainy season turned paths to mud
- **Cleared agricultural zones:** Approaches to towns involved crossing open farmland, exposing attackers
- **Settlement pattern:** Dispersed villages and fortified towns, each requiring separate reduction

Ewuare's success in forest warfare indicates mastery of this environment — knowing how to move forces through the vegetation, how to approach and reduce fortified positions, how to maintain supply and cohesion in difficult terrain.

### Lessons

Ewuare's War illustrates several patterns significant for understanding African military history:

1. **Succession crises could be catastrophically destructive:** The civil war phase shows how disputed successions, without effective mechanisms for resolution, could devastate entire kingdoms.

2. **Political and military success were intertwined:** Ewuare won not merely through fighting but through political skill — building coalitions, timing his return, consolidating support.

3. **Forest warfare was slow and grinding:** Unlike the rapid cavalry campaigns of the Sahel, forest-zone expansion required patient, systematic reduction of one position at a time.

4. **Centralization could emerge from civil war:** Ewuare's political reforms, concentrating power in the Oba's hands, were directly shaped by the experience of civil war. The crisis taught that dispersed power could lead to catastrophic conflict.

5. **Military success could fund state-building:** The resources extracted from conquest — tribute, labor, captives — supported the massive construction projects that transformed Benin City.

## Scholarly Debates

| Question | Position A | Position B | Current Consensus |
|----------|------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Dating of the conflict** | c. 1440s (Egharevba's traditional dating based on king-list chronology) | Alternative chronologies suggest variations of a decade or more in either direction | [D] Traditional dating generally accepted but without independent confirmation |
| **Historicity of the exile narrative** | Historical core — succession struggles and exile were common in West African kingdoms | Narrative shaped by epic conventions (parallels to Sundiata); specific details may be legendary | [D] General pattern plausible; specific details [T] Traditional/Oral |
| **Scale of the civil war destruction** | Devastating conflict requiring complete rebuilding of Benin City | Oral tradition may exaggerate to enhance Ewuare's achievement in reconstruction | [D] Significant destruction probable; archaeological evidence confirms major construction under Ewuare |
| **"201 towns" conquest claim** | Indicates genuine large-scale expansion | Conventional number indicating "many"; not to be taken literally | [D] Large-scale expansion occurred; precise number [T] Traditional/Oral |
| **Attribution of walls to Ewuare** | Tradition credits Ewuare with initiating the wall system | Archaeological evidence shows walls constructed over centuries; Ewuare's specific contribution uncertain | [D] Ewuare likely initiated major construction phase but not solely responsible for entire system |

### The Exile Narrative Problem

The story of Ewuare's exile and return follows patterns common in West African oral tradition. The Sundiata epic, which tells of the founding of the Mali Empire, similarly features a prince driven into exile who returns to claim his rightful throne and transform his society. This parallel raises the question of whether the Ewuare tradition reflects historical memory or has been shaped by established narrative conventions.

Several considerations are relevant:

1. **Succession crises were historically common:** Violent struggles over succession occurred frequently in West African kingdoms. The pattern of exile and return is not merely a narrative convention but reflects recurrent historical dynamics.

2. **Oral tradition serves multiple functions:** The exile narrative not only records (putative) events but also conveys meanings — the hero's resilience, the injustice of his exclusion, the inevitability of legitimate power's restoration. These meanings may have shaped the telling.

3. **Centuries of transmission:** The traditions were recorded in the twentieth century, more than four hundred years after Ewuare's reign. This allows substantial scope for elaboration, standardization, and the influence of other narratives.

4. **Internal consistency:** The traditions are reasonably consistent about the general pattern even while varying in details. This suggests a persistent core of memory even if specific elements have been transformed.

The safest conclusion is that Ewuare probably experienced some form of political displacement before his accession — succession crises were too common for the tradition to be entirely invented — but the specific details of his exile and return should be treated as [T] Traditional/Oral rather than historically established.

### The Benin Walls Question

The Benin earthwork walls are archaeologically real and monumentally impressive. Patrick Darling's survey documented over 16,000 kilometers of walls, moats, and earthworks surrounding Benin City and extending throughout the surrounding territory. This represents one of the largest construction projects in human history before the age of machines.

The question is how much of this system was built under Ewuare specifically versus being accumulated over centuries of construction. The evidence suggests:

1. **Long construction period:** The walls were not built all at once but represent centuries of construction and extension.

2. **Multiple phases:** Different sections of the walls appear to date to different periods based on archaeological analysis.

3. **Traditional attribution:** Oral tradition consistently credits Ewuare with the walls, or at least with initiating the major construction.

4. **Pattern of cultural memory:** Founder figures are often credited with achievements that were actually collective and extended over time.

The most likely interpretation is that Ewuare initiated a major phase of wall construction — particularly around the capital itself, which required rebuilding after the civil war — but that the entire system as documented by Darling represents the work of many generations before and after his reign.

## For Fiction Writing

### Dramatic Potential

Ewuare's Civil War offers exceptional material for historical fiction, combining multiple dramatic structures within a single narrative arc:

**The exile story:** A prince driven from his home, stripped of everything, surviving by his wits in the forest wilderness. This is the classic "hero in the wilderness" motif found in traditions from Homer to West African griots. The exile tests the hero's resilience, strips away external supports, and forces him to discover what he truly is. The years of wandering provide opportunity for adventure, encounter with strange peoples and places, moments of despair and renewal, and the slow accumulation of the followers and resources that will enable return.

**The fratricidal tragedy:** Meanwhile, back in Benin City, the hero's brothers destroy each other and the kingdom. This is tragedy in the classical sense — men driven by ambition and pride to mutual destruction, pulling down the world around them. The civil war provides a counterpoint to the exile narrative, showing what the hero escapes and what he will have to rebuild.

**The return and transformation:** The prince returns to a ruined city, seizes power, and begins the work of reconstruction. This is the builder-hero motif, the ruler who creates order from chaos. The transformation of Benin from ruins to magnificence provides dramatic satisfaction — the hero not only wins but creates something that outlasts him.

**The conqueror's campaigns:** The expansion that follows offers adventure narrative — battles, sieges, the encounter with different peoples, the extension of power across a forested world. Each campaign can be a story in itself, with its own characters, stakes, and resolution.

**The final tragedy:** And then, at the height of triumph, the loss of both sons. The king who achieved everything loses what matters most — the continuation of his line, the future he thought he had secured. This transforms the narrative from triumph to tragedy, adding emotional depth and moral complexity.

### Sensory Details

#### Sight

**The forest world:** Dense canopy filtering sunlight into green gloom. Massive trees rising from tangled undergrowth. Clearings where villages nestle amid farmland. Red-brown earth paths winding through vegetation. The colors of tropical birds glimpsed through leaves.

**The ruined city:** Burnt buildings, collapsed walls, streets choked with debris. The palace compound damaged and abandoned. Weeds growing through what had been orderly spaces. The visual markers of catastrophe.

**The rebuilt city:** Massive earthwork walls rising from deep moats. Wide straight roads. Organized quarters for different occupations. The palace compound, enormous and elaborate, its pillars covered with bronze plaques gleaming in the light.

**Military scenes:** Infantry columns moving along forest paths. Warriors armed with swords, spears, crossbows. No cavalry — this is foot-soldier country. Fortified towns with walls and ditches. The visual confusion of forest combat.

**The bronzes:** Commemorative heads with elaborate headdresses and coral-bead collars. Relief plaques depicting court scenes — the Oba enthroned, warriors in formation, rituals in progress. The deep brown-gold color of aged bronze; the glint of fresh casting.

#### Sound

**Forest soundscape:** Bird calls, insect hum, wind in leaves. The crack of branches underfoot. The splash of rain on vegetation. Rivers running over rocks.

**Urban soundscape:** Voices in markets and workshops. The ring of hammers from smithies. Drums — except during the mourning period, when their silence was thunderous.

**Battle sounds:** War cries and screams. The clash of iron weapons. The hiss and thud of arrows. The sounds of bodies falling.

**Court soundscape:** Ivory horns announcing the Oba's movements. Bells of various tones. Praise-singers reciting genealogies and deeds. The formal greetings of court protocol.

#### Smell

**Forest smells:** Wet vegetation. Rotting leaf matter. Flowers — some sweet, some heavy. The smoke of cooking fires from distant villages.

**Urban smells:** Cooking food (palm oil, pepper, yams). Animal pens. The chemical sharpness of bronze-foundry work. Incense in ritual spaces. The human smells of a tropical city before modern sanitation.

**Battle smells:** Sweat and fear. Blood. The dust or mud of churned ground.

**Workshop smells:** Hot metal in the bronze-casting foundries. Charcoal smoke. The earthy smell of clay molds.

#### Touch/Feel

**Forest textures:** Rough bark and smooth leaves. Sticky mud sucking at feet. The scratch of thorns and undergrowth. Humidity lying on skin like a wet cloth.

**Weapons:** The weight of an iron sword. The tension of a drawn crossbow. The grain of a wooden spear shaft.

**Royal regalia:** The smooth heaviness of bronze. The intricate patterns of coral beadwork — thousands of small beads strung and woven into collars, crowns, anklets. The slick texture of palm oil used in royal rituals.

**Climate:** Heat — constant, heavy, draining. The relief of shade and the burden of sun. The coolness of the moats. The wet season's rain, warm and relentless.

#### Taste

**Food:** Pepper — Benin was known for its pepper trade. Palm oil rich in everything. Yams prepared in dozens of ways. Kola nuts (bitter, stimulating, offered in welcome). Fermented palm wine.

**Battle:** The taste of dust or mud. Thirst. Blood from a split lip.

**Ritual:** The foods offered to ancestors. The particular preparations for festivals.

### Character Moments

**Ewuare in exile:** The former prince working as a laborer, hiding his identity. The moment when someone recognizes him — fear of betrayal or hope of alliance? The grinding repetition of survival. The moments of despair when return seems impossible.

**The brothers' hatred:** Scenes showing how the conflict between Uwaifiokun and Ogun escalated from rivalry to war. Each convinced of his own righteousness; each determined that the other must be destroyed. The chief who tries to mediate and fails. The moment when the first blood is shed.

**The return:** Ewuare's first sight of ruined Benin City after years of exile. The recognition that everything he remembered is gone. The hardening of resolve to rebuild.

**The coronation:** The moment when the exiled prince becomes Oba — the weight of the coral crown, the praise-names ringing out, the realization that the long struggle is over and the real work begins.

**The builder at work:** Ewuare overseeing the wall construction, the palace rebuilding, the bronze-casting. The patience required for work that would take years. Conversations with guild masters about what should be created and why.

**The conqueror on campaign:** The tedium of siege warfare; the flash of combat; the moment of victory and the decision of what to do with the defeated. The weight of command.

**The bronze-casters:** Craftsmen creating commemorative heads — discussing with the Oba what should be depicted, what the bronze should convey. The technical challenges of lost-wax casting; the religious significance of the finished work.

**The epidemic:** The news that sickness has come. The death of the first son — shock, denial, then the second son falls ill. The Oba's command that all drumming cease, that no one may bathe or lie with their spouse — private grief becoming public ritual.

**The empty throne room:** Late in Ewuare's reign. The Oba surrounded by the monuments of his achievement — the bronzes, the rebuilt palace, the walls — contemplating a future without heirs. The question of what all the building was for, if there is no one to inherit.

### Before Battle

#### Rituals and Preparation

Benin warfare was embedded in religious practice. Before campaigns:

- **Divination:** Consulting oracles about whether to proceed and what approach to take
- **Sacrifices:** Offerings to ancestors and deities for victory
- **Protective rituals:** Medicines and charms believed to protect warriors and ensure success
- **Praise-singing:** Recitation of past victories and the deeds of ancestors to inspire the current warriors
- **The Oba's blessing:** Royal ritual channeling the Oba's spiritual power (ase) to the army

These practices were not peripheral but central — a campaign launched without proper ritual preparation was thought doomed to failure.

#### Omens and Signs

Edo belief included attention to omens that might indicate the outcome of ventures. Unusual animal behavior, dreams, the appearance of certain birds or creatures — all might be interpreted as messages about the future. A fiction narrative could incorporate such signs, showing how the characters interpreted and responded to them.

#### The Army Assembling

The gathering of forces for a campaign — professional warriors from their quarters, conscripts from the villages, the organization of supplies and equipment. The movement from peace to war as a social transition affecting the entire community.

### After Battle

#### Treatment of the Dead

Both sides' dead required attention. Benin practice included:

- **Recovery of the fallen:** Bodies brought back for proper burial where possible
- **Ancestor-making:** The dead became ancestors requiring commemoration
- **Trophy-taking:** Some victories may have involved taking trophies from enemy dead
- **Mass graves:** When bodies could not be properly treated, burial in communal graves

#### Treatment of Prisoners

Captives faced various fates:

- **Sacrifice:** Some prisoners were sacrificed in rituals, particularly significant prisoners
- **Incorporation:** Many became workers within the Benin economy
- **Trade:** Some entered regional slave-trade networks
- **Ransoming:** Important prisoners might be ransomed to their communities

#### Victory Celebrations

Successful campaigns were marked by:

- **Triumphal entry:** The victorious army returning to Benin City
- **Presentation to the Oba:** Captives and spoils displayed before the throne
- **Ritual thanksgiving:** Offerings to the powers that granted victory
- **Distribution of rewards:** Shares of spoils to deserving warriors and commanders

### Worldview and Values

Understanding Ewuare's world requires grasping Edo cultural assumptions:

**Ase (spiritual power):** The Oba possessed exceptional ase — the force that enabled effective action in the world. His victories demonstrated his ase; his rebuilding of Benin City manifested it in physical form. Ase was not abstract; it was real force that shaped events.

**Ancestors and continuity:** The dead remained present, requiring commemoration and influencing the living. The dynasty was not merely a political succession but a line of ancestral power connecting past, present, and future. This is why the loss of Ewuare's sons was catastrophic — it threatened to break the chain.

**Order and chaos:** The civil war represented a collapse of proper order — the hierarchy of positions, the rituals that maintained cosmic balance, the structures that made civilized life possible. Ewuare's achievement was restoring order, and the name he adopted ("the trouble has ceased") directly expressed this.

**Transformation through catastrophe:** The Edo worldview could accommodate the idea that destruction might precede creation, that the civil war's devastation enabled the rebuilt kingdom's glory. Ewuare's story embodied this pattern.

**Commemoration:** The bronzes, the rituals, the igue festival — all served to preserve memory. What was remembered could not be lost; what was properly commemorated could continue to influence the present. Ewuare built not merely buildings but commemorations.

### Scene Seeds

1. **The prince becomes a laborer:** Ewuare, identity hidden, working in a village far from Benin. A moment of recognition — someone sees the royal bearing beneath the ragged clothes. What happens next?

2. **Brothers' last meeting:** Uwaifiokun and Ogun facing each other one final time. What is said? What is not said? The moment when the last possibility of peace dies.

3. **News reaches the exile:** Ewuare learns that his brothers have destroyed each other. The decision that he must return now or never. The first steps on the road home.

4. **Entering the ruins:** Ewuare's first sight of what the civil war did to Benin City. Standing in the damaged palace compound, seeing the destruction. The vow to rebuild.

5. **The name-taking:** The ceremony in which the new Oba adopts the name "Ewuare." The public declaration; the private meaning.

6. **Laying the first stone:** The beginning of the wall construction. Ewuare explaining to his officials what he envisions. The first earth moved for the new walls.

7. **The bronze-caster's audience:** A guild master presenting a completed commemorative head to the Oba. Discussion of what it represents, what it achieves, what should be made next.

8. **Siege of a forest town:** A specific campaign, rendered in detail. The approach through the forest, the investment of the town, the waiting, the final assault.

9. **The festival of the dead:** The first igue ceremony. The rituals commemorating those killed in the civil war — including the brothers Ewuare defeated. The Oba presiding over a ceremony that remembers his enemies as well as his friends.

10. **The sons' deaths:** The epidemic striking the princes. The Oba's vigil. The moment when it becomes clear both heirs are lost. The proclamation of mourning that silences the drums across the kingdom.

11. **The empty palace:** Ewuare in his final years, alone with his achievements. Walking through the palace he rebuilt, looking at the bronzes, knowing there will be no son to inherit what he created.

## Sources

### Primary Sources

#### Oral Tradition (Egharevba Compilations)

**Jacob Egharevba, *A Short History of Benin* (1934; 4th ed. 1968):** The most important source for Benin's internal history. Egharevba was a court historian who compiled oral traditions preserved at the Benin court. His work provides the narrative of Ewuare's exile, return, and reign, including the traditions about the civil war and the death of his sons.

**Reliability:** [P] Probable for general patterns; [T] Traditional/Oral for specific narrative details. The traditions were recorded more than four centuries after Ewuare's time, allowing considerable scope for elaboration and transformation. Egharevba himself may have organized and interpreted the material he collected. Nevertheless, this remains the essential source for Benin's dynastic history.

#### Portuguese Accounts (1480s-1500s)

Portuguese traders and emissaries reached Benin City in the decade after Ewuare's death. Their accounts describe the kingdom they found — the impressive city, the powerful Oba, the elaborate court — which reflects the state Ewuare had built.

**Key accounts:**
- Ruy de Pina's chronicle (1485-1490s)
- Duarte Pacheco Pereira's *Esmeraldo de Situ Orbis* (c. 1505-1508)
- João de Barros's *Décadas da Ásia* (1552)

**Reliability:** [E] Established for what Portuguese observers saw; limited for Ewuare specifically since he died before Portuguese arrival. These sources confirm the existence of a powerful, sophisticated kingdom but do not directly describe the civil war or Ewuare's personal history.

#### Archaeological Evidence

**Patrick Darling's survey of the Benin walls** (1970s-1980s, published in *Archaeology and History in Southern Nigeria*, 1984): Comprehensive documentation of the earthwork system's extent and construction methods. Confirms the monumental scale of the walls attributed to Ewuare in tradition.

**Reliability:** [E] Established for the existence and scale of the walls; [D] Debated for specific attribution to Ewuare's reign.

**Other archaeological work** on Benin City has documented construction phases, material culture, and urban organization, providing context for the oral traditions.

### Secondary Sources

**Egharevba, Jacob, *A Short History of Benin* (1934; 4th ed. 1968):** Serves as both primary source (recording oral tradition) and secondary source (Egharevba's organization and interpretation).

**Ben-Amos, Paula Girshick, *The Art of Benin* (1980; revised 1995):** The definitive study of Benin's artistic tradition, including the bronze-casting under Ewuare and his successors. Essential for understanding the cultural context of Ewuare's patronage.

**Connah, Graham, *African Civilizations: An Archaeological Perspective* (1987; 3rd ed. 2015):** Places Benin in the broader context of African urban and state development. Useful for comparative perspective on the wall construction and urbanization.

**Darling, Patrick, *Archaeology and History in Southern Nigeria* (1984):** Archaeological survey of the Benin walls. Essential for understanding the scale and construction methods of the earthworks.

**Ryder, A.F.C., *Benin and the Europeans, 1485-1897* (1969):** Standard history of Benin's external relations, including the Portuguese contact shortly after Ewuare's death. Provides context for the kingdom the Europeans encountered.

**Bradbury, R.E., *Benin Studies* (1973):** Anthropological studies of Benin political organization and ritual. Essential for understanding the structures Ewuare reformed.

### Source Assessment

The evidence for Ewuare's Civil War presents the characteristic challenges of African historical research:

1. **Oral tradition provides narrative but not verification:** The Egharevba compilations give us a coherent story of exile, civil war, return, and transformation, but this story cannot be independently confirmed. The narrative may have been shaped by centuries of transmission and by the conventions of heroic storytelling.

2. **Portuguese sources confirm results but not process:** European visitors found a powerful kingdom with a magnificent capital, confirming that something like the tradition's narrative of reconstruction occurred, but they arrived too late to directly document Ewuare or the civil war.

3. **Archaeological evidence confirms scale but not attribution:** The walls are monumentally real, but we cannot archaeologically determine exactly what was built during Ewuare's reign versus before or after.

4. **The decolonizing framework matters:** Earlier European scholars sometimes dismissed oral tradition as mere legend or exaggerated the role of external influences. Current scholarship takes oral tradition seriously as evidence while recognizing its limitations as a historical source.

The result is a picture that is reliable in broad outline — a transformative ruler who reshaped Benin in the mid-fifteenth century through a process involving civil war, restoration, and expansion — but uncertain in specifics. The confidence level is appropriately [T] Traditional/Oral for most narrative details, with [P] Probable for the general pattern and [E] Established for the material evidence of reconstruction and bronze-casting tradition.
