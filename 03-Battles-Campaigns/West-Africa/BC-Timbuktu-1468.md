## Overview

The capture of Timbuktu in 1468 marked the beginning of Songhai's transformation from a regional power centered on Gao into the largest empire medieval West Africa had ever seen. When Sunni Ali Ber expelled the Tuareg occupiers who had controlled the city since 1433, he did more than liberate a wealthy trading center — he announced a new era in Sahelian politics and set in motion a series of conquests that would extend Songhai dominion across the entire Niger Bend. The campaign was militarily swift; its consequences would reverberate for generations.

Yet the capture of Timbuktu also planted the seeds of one of the most controversial episodes in West African historiography. According to the chronicles written by Timbuktu's scholarly class — the *Tarikh al-Sudan* and *Tarikh al-Fattash* — Sunni Ali turned on the very scholars who had allegedly invited him to liberate their city, punishing those who had accommodated themselves to Tuareg rule. The persecution that followed, whether extensive or exaggerated, created a lasting enmity between the Songhai military establishment and Timbuktu's ulama. This conflict would shape how Sunni Ali was remembered: not as a liberator but as a tyrant, not as a founder of empire but as an enemy of learning and faith.

The capture of Timbuktu thus presents the historian — and the fiction writer — with a narrative of extraordinary complexity. It is simultaneously a story of military liberation and political repression, of empire-building and cultural conflict, of a city that called for rescue and then regretted its rescuer. Understanding this event requires grappling with biased sources, contested motivations, and the permanent tension between military power and scholarly authority that runs through the history of Islamic civilization.

## Background and Causes

### Political Context: Mali's Decline and the Power Vacuum

By the mid-fifteenth century, the Mali Empire — the dominant power in the western Sahel since Sundiata's victories in the 1230s — had entered a period of terminal decline. The causes were multiple: succession disputes that destabilized the throne, provincial governors who asserted increasing autonomy, and the relentless pressure of rivals on every frontier. The Mossi kingdoms raided from the south; the Tuareg threatened from the north; Songhai was rising in the east. The Mansa's writ, which had once extended from the Atlantic to the Niger Bend, contracted year by year toward the Mande heartland. [P]

Timbuktu, positioned at the northernmost reach of the Niger River where the great waterway approaches closest to the Sahara, was one of the most valuable prizes in this fragmenting political landscape. Founded as a seasonal Tuareg camp in the eleventh or twelfth century, it had grown under Mali's patronage into a commercial center of continental importance and, increasingly, a center of Islamic scholarship. Mansa Musa's famous hajj of 1324-25 had poured wealth into the city; the architect al-Sahili had built or rebuilt its great mosque, Djinguereber; scholars from across the Islamic world had settled there, attracted by royal patronage and the city's position at the crossroads of trans-Saharan trade. [E]

In 1433, Mali's weakening grip finally failed. The Tuareg, pastoral nomads who had always maintained an uneasy relationship with the sedentary populations of the Sahel, seized Timbuktu under their chief Akil Ag-Amalwal. For thirty-five years, the Tuareg controlled the city, extracting tribute and regulating trade while allowing its commercial and scholarly activities to continue. The occupation was oppressive enough to generate resentment but not so brutal as to destroy the city's functions. Timbuktu remained wealthy; Timbuktu remained learned; but Timbuktu was no longer free. [E]

### Immediate Cause: The Invitation (Alleged)

According to the *Tarikh al-Sudan*, the scholars of Timbuktu, suffering under Tuareg exactions, secretly sent a message to Sunni Ali inviting him to liberate the city. The chronicle identifies the messenger as Muhammad Naddi, who reportedly traveled to Gao to urge the Songhai ruler to intervene. The message allegedly emphasized the scholars' suffering and presented Songhai intervention as a rescue mission. [T]

This invitation, if it occurred, has profound implications for understanding what followed. If Timbuktu's scholars genuinely invited Sunni Ali's intervention, then his subsequent harsh treatment of them appears as a betrayal — they called for a liberator and received a persecutor. The chronicles present the invitation as historical fact, but modern scholars have questioned whether it represents an actual diplomatic exchange or a later construction designed to heighten the narrative of Sunni Ali's perfidy. [D]

Several considerations complicate the invitation narrative:

1. **Political convenience:** The invitation allows the chroniclers to present Sunni Ali's actions as betrayal rather than conquest — a more damning framing
2. **Source bias:** The chroniclers were descendants of the same scholarly community allegedly betrayed; they had every reason to emphasize their predecessors' innocence
3. **Selective memory:** Even if some scholars invited Songhai intervention, others may have accommodated Tuareg rule; the invitation may have represented one faction, not the entire ulama [D]

### Strategic Objectives

**Sunni Ali's objectives** were relatively straightforward: Timbuktu offered commercial wealth (control of the trans-Saharan exchange), strategic position (the northern anchor of the Niger trade route), and prestige (possession of the most famous city in the western Sudan). Capturing it would announce Songhai's imperial ambitions and provide resources for further expansion. [P]

**The Tuareg's objectives** were to maintain their profitable occupation and resist any challenger. The Tuareg presence in Timbuktu was essentially extractive — they drew revenue from the city's trade without contributing to its economic or intellectual life. Their position depended on Mali's weakness and Songhai's passivity; once either condition changed, they were vulnerable. [P]

**The Timbuktu scholars' objectives** (if they indeed invited Songhai intervention) were presumably to exchange an oppressive foreign occupation for a more sympathetic overlord. They may have expected that a fellow Muslim ruler — even one with a reputation for religious ambiguity — would treat them better than Saharan nomads whom they regarded as barely civilized. If so, they miscalculated badly. [S/D]

## The Belligerents

### Songhai Forces

**Commander:** [[02-Prosopography/West-Africa/Songhai-Empire/HF-Sunni-Ali|Sunni Ali Ber]] (r. 1464-1492)

Sunni Ali had come to power in 1464 as the sixteenth ruler of the Za/Sonni dynasty, which had governed the Songhai people at Gao for centuries. Though he had been ruler for only four years at the time of the Timbuktu campaign, he was already demonstrating the military genius that would make him one of the great conquerors of African history. The chronicles, hostile to him on religious grounds, nonetheless acknowledge his extraordinary martial abilities. The *Tarikh al-Sudan* states simply: "He was always victorious and never suffered defeat." [E]

**Forces:** The precise composition and size of Sunni Ali's army are unknown. Songhai military tradition emphasized:

- **Cavalry:** Horse-mounted warriors formed the elite striking force. Horses, acquired through the trans-Saharan trade, were expensive and prestigious; cavalry units represented the military aristocracy. Sunni Ali himself was an accomplished horseman whose personal speed became legendary — the chronicles claim he covered the distance from Gao to Timbuktu in a single night, a clear exaggeration that nonetheless reflects his reputation for rapid maneuver. [T]
- **Infantry:** Foot soldiers provided the mass of the army, armed with iron-tipped spears, swords, and bows.
- **River fleet:** Unlike other Sahelian powers, Songhai maintained a substantial fleet of war canoes on the Niger. Whether the fleet played a role in the Timbuktu campaign is unknown, but Sunni Ali's later campaigns (especially the siege of Djenne) would demonstrate his skill in combining land and river operations. [S]

**Strengths:**
- **Experienced leadership:** Sunni Ali was a veteran commander even at this early stage of his reign
- **Cavalry mobility:** The ability to move rapidly across the Sahel gave Songhai forces strategic initiative
- **Motivation:** Songhai was an expanding power with everything to gain
- **Intelligence:** If the invitation from Timbuktu's scholars was genuine, Sunni Ali may have received information about Tuareg dispositions and city defenses [P]

**Weaknesses:**
- **Distance:** Gao to Timbuktu is approximately 300 kilometers across difficult terrain
- **Desert margins:** Approaching the Saharan fringe exposed supply lines to interdiction
- **Unknown numbers:** Whether Sunni Ali commanded a massive army or a relatively small elite force is uncertain [S]

### Tuareg Forces

**Commander:** Akil Ag-Amalwal (also: Akil, Chief of the Maghsharan Tuareg)

Akil Ag-Amalwal had led the Tuareg seizure of Timbuktu in 1433 and remained the dominant figure in the city's occupation for over three decades. He was a successful desert warlord whose people had prospered from their control of Timbuktu, but his position depended on the weakness of neighboring states. [P]

**Forces:** The Tuareg military tradition was based on:

- **Camel-mounted warriors:** The Tuareg were masters of desert warfare, using camels for mobility across terrain where horses could not survive. Their veiled warriors, known for their indigo-dyed robes that stained their skin blue, struck fear across the Sahel.
- **Raiding tactics:** Tuareg warfare emphasized mobility, surprise, and the ability to disappear into the desert. They excelled at raiding and extraction but were less effective in defensive warfare against a determined assault.
- **Limited garrison:** The Tuareg controlled Timbuktu through a relatively small occupation force, relying on intimidation and the absence of alternatives rather than overwhelming military presence. [P]

**Strengths:**
- **Desert expertise:** In the Sahara, the Tuareg were nearly invincible
- **Mobility:** The ability to retreat into the desert made complete annihilation difficult
- **Established position:** Thirty-five years of occupation had created networks of informants and collaborators [P]

**Weaknesses:**
- **Limited numbers:** The Tuareg occupation force was probably small relative to a full Songhai army
- **Defensive disadvantage:** Tuareg military culture was adapted for raiding, not holding fixed positions
- **Uncertain loyalty:** The Timbuktu population had no reason to fight for their occupiers; at least some actively invited their overthrow
- **No external support:** Mali was too weak to challenge Songhai; the Tuareg were on their own [P]

## The Campaign

### Approach and Movement

The chronicles provide frustratingly little detail about the actual military operations. What emerges is a picture of rapid movement rather than prolonged campaigning.

According to the *Tarikh al-Sudan*, Sunni Ali moved with extraordinary speed once he committed to the operation. The famous claim that he covered the distance from Gao to Timbuktu "in a single night" is clearly hyperbolic — the journey is approximately 300 kilometers — but it reflects the operational tempo that characterized his campaigns. Sunni Ali's strategic genius lay partly in his ability to concentrate force rapidly and strike before enemies could prepare. [T/P]

The route from Gao to Timbuktu follows the Niger River through the Niger Bend, moving generally northward and then westward. This terrain — semi-arid Sahel with seasonal flooding — was familiar to Songhai forces and accessible to cavalry. The campaign appears to have occurred during the dry season, when the floodplains would have been passable. [P]

### The Seizure: What We Know

The capture of Timbuktu was not a siege but a swift takeover. Several factors suggest this:

1. **Absence of siege narrative:** The chronicles, which provide detailed accounts of Sunni Ali's seven-year siege of Djenne, offer no comparable siege narrative for Timbuktu. The city appears to have fallen quickly.
2. **Tuareg flight:** Akil Ag-Amalwal fled rather than fighting to the death. The Tuareg could retreat into the desert, where pursuit was impractical; this escape route may have made determined resistance seem pointless.
3. **Possible inside assistance:** If Timbuktu's scholars genuinely invited Songhai intervention, they may have facilitated entry — opening gates, providing intelligence, or undermining Tuareg authority from within. [P/S]

The military operation itself appears to have been anticlimactic — a rapid advance, Tuareg flight, and Songhai occupation. The drama would come after.

### Decisive Factor

The decisive factor was almost certainly the balance of forces and the psychology of the occupation. The Tuareg garrison, whatever its size, faced a full Songhai army under an aggressive commander. The Tuareg could fight and lose, or they could retreat to the desert and survive. They chose survival. Akil Ag-Amalwal withdrew, ceding Timbuktu to Songhai control.

This was not cowardice but rational calculation. Tuareg military culture valued mobility and survival; dying in the defense of a city whose population resented them made no strategic sense. Akil and his people retreated to the Saharan margins, from which they would continue to threaten Songhai territories for years. Sunni Ali spent much of his reign conducting counter-raids against the Tuareg precisely because they had not been destroyed in 1468. [P]

## Aftermath

### Immediate Consequences: Sunni Ali Takes Timbuktu

Sunni Ali entered Timbuktu as a conqueror. The city, which had been under Tuareg occupation since 1433, now belonged to the Songhai Empire. Commercially, this was an enormous gain: Timbuktu controlled a major node of the trans-Saharan trade, where goods from the gold-producing south met goods from the salt-producing Sahara. Symbolically, it was even more significant: the most famous city in the western Sudan now acknowledged Songhai sovereignty. [E]

But what followed the military victory would prove far more consequential than the victory itself.

### The Persecution: The Timbuktu Scholars and Their Charges

According to the *Tarikh al-Sudan* and *Tarikh al-Fattash*, Sunni Ali punished the scholars of Timbuktu who had collaborated with the Tuareg occupation. The charges were essentially political: these scholars had accommodated themselves to foreign rule, accepted Tuareg patronage, and in some cases actively cooperated with the occupiers. Whether they had also failed to support the invitation to Sunni Ali — or whether the invitation itself was a fabrication — cannot be determined. [D]

The chronicles record specific grievances:

**Against the Qadi of Timbuktu:** The city's chief Islamic judge reportedly suffered humiliation and persecution. Whether this individual had collaborated with the Tuareg or simply represented the scholarly establishment is unclear. [T]

**Execution and exile:** Some scholars were allegedly killed; others fled to Walata (a rival trading city in the western Sahara) or other places of refuge. The *Tarikh al-Fattash* presents a picture of wholesale persecution, with the learned class driven from the city. [T]

**Contempt for learning:** The chronicles allege that Sunni Ali showed general contempt for Islamic scholarship, preferring illiterate warriors and mocking bookish knowledge. This characterization fits the chroniclers' portrait of a religiously ambiguous ruler but may also reflect class conflict between the military aristocracy and the scholarly elite. [D]

**Blasphemous statements:** Both chronicles attribute heterodox religious statements to Sunni Ali, suggesting he questioned the Prophet's authority or dismissed Islamic law. Such allegations are difficult to assess — they may reflect genuine religious heterodoxy or may be rhetorical attacks on a political enemy. [T/D]

### Historiographical Caution: Reading the Sources

The accounts of persecution must be treated with extreme care. Consider the sources:

**The *Tarikh al-Sudan*** was written by Abd al-Rahman al-Sa'di around 1650, approximately 180 years after the events described. Al-Sa'di was a Timbuktu scholar, a member of the learned class whose predecessors Sunni Ali had allegedly persecuted. His account is detailed and specific, but his perspective is unmistakably that of the scholarly community.

**The *Tarikh al-Fattash*** has a more complex textual history, with sections written by Mahmud Kati (who may have lived during Sunni Ali's time) and later additions by his descendants. It shares the Timbuktu perspective and the negative assessment of Sunni Ali.

Both chronicles were written after Askia Muhammad I — who overthrew Sunni Ali's son and founded a new dynasty — had patronized the Timbuktu scholarly community. The chroniclers had strong incentive to contrast the "bad" Sonni dynasty with the "good" Askia dynasty. This is not to say they fabricated the persecution, but their accounts are not neutral. [E]

Modern historians have proposed several alternative interpretations:

1. **Political punishment, not religious persecution:** Sunni Ali may have punished scholars who had actively collaborated with the Tuareg, treating them as political collaborators with a foreign occupation rather than targeting them for their faith or learning. This would make his actions harsh but comprehensible within the political logic of conquest.

2. **Exaggeration:** The scale of the persecution may have been inflated over generations of chronicle-writing. A relatively limited action against specific collaborators may have grown, in the scholarly memory, into a wholesale attack on learning and faith.

3. **Class conflict:** The tension may reflect conflict between the military aristocracy (which Sunni Ali represented) and the scholarly elite (the ulama), a pattern common in Islamic history. Sunni Ali's "impiety" may have consisted partly in refusing to defer to scholarly authority — a political challenge dressed in religious rhetoric.

4. **Factional conflict:** Not all scholars may have supported the invitation to Sunni Ali; those who had genuinely collaborated with the Tuareg may have been enemies of those who had invited Songhai intervention. Sunni Ali's actions may have reflected one faction's revenge on another, with subsequent chroniclers eliding the distinction. [D]

### Treatment of the Defeated

**The Tuareg:** Akil Ag-Amalwal and his forces fled into the Sahara, where they continued to pose a threat to Songhai territories. Sunni Ali spent much of his reign conducting campaigns against the Tuareg on the desert margins. The Tuareg were pushed back but never eliminated — they remained a persistent security problem.

**The Timbuktu population:** The general population of Timbuktu appears to have accepted Songhai rule without major disruption. The city continued to function as a commercial center; trade continued to flow. The persecution, such as it was, targeted the scholarly elite, not the merchant community or general population.

**The scholars:** Those who suffered punishment fled, died, or accommodated themselves to the new regime. Over time, a new equilibrium emerged, though the relationship between Sunni Ali and the ulama remained hostile. The scholars remembered; they wrote; and they ensured that Sunni Ali would be remembered as a tyrant. [P]

### Long-Term Impact

**Imperial expansion:** The capture of Timbuktu launched Songhai's imperial career. Within five years, Sunni Ali would capture Djenne (c. 1473), giving him control of the two most important cities of the Middle Niger. By his death in 1492, the Songhai Empire extended from the Niger Bend to the approaches of Hausaland. The territorial foundation was laid in 1468.

**The scholarly memory:** The events of 1468 and their aftermath shaped how Sunni Ali would be remembered for centuries. The Timbuktu chronicles, transmitted through generations of scholars, preserved the memory of persecution. When modern historians encountered these sources, they initially accepted the hostile portrait; only recently has systematic source criticism begun to question the traditional narrative.

**The scholar-state tension:** The conflict between Sunni Ali and the ulama established a pattern that would persist throughout Songhai's imperial history. The scholars wielded cultural authority; the military aristocracy wielded political power. The two were necessary to each other but never fully reconciled. Askia Muhammad I would cultivate the scholars, but even his patronage could not entirely resolve the tension.

## Military Analysis

### Tactics and Strategy

**Sunni Ali's strategy** was one of rapid concentration and decisive action. Rather than prolonged campaigning, he struck quickly, presenting the Tuareg with an overwhelming force that made resistance futile. This approach — speed, surprise, and the concentration of force — characterized his military career. [P]

**The Tuareg strategy** of retreat preserved their forces but ceded the objective. It was rational but ultimately inadequate: the Tuareg lost Timbuktu and never recovered it. Their subsequent raiding from the desert margins was a nuisance, not a strategic threat.

### Technology

The technological balance in 1468 was relatively even. Neither side possessed firearms; this was eighty years before the Portuguese introduced muskets to the West African coast and over a century before the Moroccan invasion would demonstrate the devastating potential of gunpowder weapons against Sahelian cavalry.

**Weapons:**
- Iron-tipped spears and lances for cavalry
- Iron swords of both West African and imported (trans-Saharan) manufacture
- Composite bows with effective range of 150-200 meters
- Leather and quilted cotton armor that provided some protection against arrows and slashing weapons

**Cavalry:** Both sides deployed mounted warriors — Songhai on horses, Tuareg on camels. Horses were more effective in the Sahel's terrain; camels excelled in the Sahara proper. The battle for Timbuktu, fought at the Saharan fringe, favored neither decisively.

### Terrain and Environment

Timbuktu sits at the edge of two worlds: the Niger floodplain to the south and the Sahara to the north. This position made it valuable — the meeting point of river and desert commerce — but also exposed.

**The approach route** from Gao followed the Niger Bend through semi-arid Sahel terrain. During the dry season, this landscape presented few obstacles to cavalry movement but required careful logistics for water and fodder.

**The city itself** was not heavily fortified in 1468. Timbuktu's defenses were modest — mud-brick walls that provided some protection but nothing comparable to the formidable water-surrounded position of Djenne. A determined assault by a substantial force was likely to succeed.

**The desert option** gave the Tuareg their escape route. The Sahara's vastness was their ultimate refuge, beyond the practical reach of Songhai cavalry. This geography ensured their survival but also their irrelevance to the question of Timbuktu's control.

### Lessons

The capture of Timbuktu illustrates several principles that characterized Sahelian warfare:

1. **Speed matters:** Sunni Ali's rapid movement prevented the Tuareg from concentrating forces or preparing defenses. The initiative belonged to the attacker.
2. **Occupation is vulnerable:** The Tuareg occupation of Timbuktu depended on the absence of alternatives. When Songhai provided an alternative, the occupation collapsed.
3. **Victory is not control:** Capturing the city was the easy part; establishing stable governance proved more challenging. Sunni Ali won the battle but lost the war for historical memory.
4. **Cultural power endures:** The scholars Sunni Ali persecuted had one weapon he could not match: they controlled the written record. Centuries later, their descendants' chronicles still shape how we understand these events.

## Scholarly Debates

| Question | Position A | Position B | Current Consensus |
|----------|------------|------------|-------------------|
| **The invitation** | Timbuktu scholars genuinely invited Sunni Ali to liberate the city from Tuareg occupation | The invitation is a literary device invented to heighten the narrative of Sunni Ali's betrayal | [D] The invitation may have occurred but cannot be independently verified; its political uses in the chronicles are evident |
| **Scale of persecution** | Sunni Ali systematically persecuted Timbuktu's ulama as enemies of his religious practices and political authority | Persecution was limited to specific political collaborators; its scale has been exaggerated by hostile sources | [D] Some persecution occurred; scale and motivation remain disputed |
| **Sunni Ali's motivation** | Religious hostility — Sunni Ali attacked the scholars because of his antipathy to Islam and preference for indigenous religion | Political calculation — Sunni Ali punished collaborators to establish his authority, regardless of religious considerations | [D] Likely a combination; religious and political factors are difficult to separate |
| **The scholars' guilt** | Many Timbuktu scholars had genuinely collaborated with Tuareg occupation, accepting patronage and legitimizing their rule | The scholars had little choice under occupation and did what was necessary to survive; collaboration was minimal | [S] Impossible to assess retrospectively; the truth likely varied by individual |
| **Chronicle reliability** | The *Tarikh al-Sudan* and *Tarikh al-Fattash* preserve genuine tradition about Sunni Ali, transmitted from eyewitnesses through reliable chains | The chronicles are propaganda serving the Askia dynasty and Timbuktu's scholarly class; they systematically distort Sunni Ali's character | [P] The chronicles are valuable primary sources but require critical reading; their bias is evident but they preserve real information |

### The Central Debate: Tyrant or Pragmatist?

The capture of Timbuktu crystallizes the fundamental question about Sunni Ali's reign: Was he the brutal persecutor of learning and faith that the chronicles describe, or a pragmatic ruler whose conflicts with the ulama have been distorted by hostile sources?

**The traditional view**, accepting the chronicles at face value, sees Sunni Ali as genuinely hostile to Islam and its scholarly representatives. His persecution of Timbuktu's scholars was systematic and ideologically motivated — an expression of his preference for indigenous Songhai religion and his contempt for bookish learning. The invitation, in this reading, makes his betrayal more complete: he destroyed the very community that had called for his help.

**The revisionist view** argues that Sunni Ali was a pragmatic conqueror whose conflicts with the Timbuktu ulama were primarily political. He punished collaborators as any conqueror might; his "impiety" consisted largely in refusing to defer to scholarly authority. The chronicles exaggerate because their authors belonged to the class he had threatened.

**A synthetic view** suggests that both elements may be present. Sunni Ali probably did practice some form of religious syncretism — observing Islamic forms while maintaining indigenous practices, as many West African rulers did. He probably did conflict with the scholarly class on both religious and political grounds. He probably did punish some scholars harshly. But the systematic persecution, the wholesale destruction, the unrelieved villainy that the chronicles present may be a product of generations of hostile memory rather than a simple reflection of what occurred.

For the historian, uncertainty is the appropriate stance. For the fiction writer, the ambiguity is an opportunity: the story can be told from multiple perspectives, with Sunni Ali as hero, villain, or something more complex than either.

## For Fiction Writing

### Dramatic Potential

**Fiction Potential: HIGH**

The capture of Timbuktu offers extraordinary material for fiction — a swift military campaign, a city changing hands, a conqueror who becomes a persecutor, and a conflict between power and learning that shapes memory for centuries. Key dramatic opportunities:

**The liberation narrative:** The Tuareg are expelled; Timbuktu is free. This is a story of deliverance — but deliverance that goes wrong. The relief of occupation's end becomes the horror of new persecution. The emotional arc moves from hope to betrayal.

**The conqueror's dilemma:** Sunni Ali faces a choice after victory: how to treat the scholars who had accommodated Tuareg rule. Does he punish collaboration or accept submission? The decision defines his relationship with Timbuktu and, ultimately, his historical legacy.

**The scholars' tragedy:** The ulama invited a liberator and received a tyrant. Their story is one of miscalculation, suffering, and eventual vindication through the written word. They lost the political struggle but won the battle for historical memory.

**The moral ambiguity:** Was Sunni Ali's persecution justice for treason or hatred of learning? The sources cannot tell us; a fiction writer can explore both possibilities. The same actions appear differently from different perspectives.

**The class conflict:** Military aristocracy versus scholarly elite — a tension that runs through Islamic history. Sunni Ali represents martial power; the ulama represent cultural authority. Neither can destroy the other entirely, but neither can they coexist peacefully.

### Sensory Details

**Sight:**

*The approach to Timbuktu:*
- The Sahel landscape: scattered acacia trees, brown grass in the dry season, the Niger River glinting in the distance
- Dust clouds raised by cavalry columns; the banners of the Songhai army
- The desert edge: where the green gives way to sand, the transition zone that defines Timbuktu's position
- Tuareg encampments in the distance: the black goat-hair tents of the nomads

*Timbuktu itself:*
- Mud-brick buildings rising from the sand: houses, warehouses, mosques, all in shades of brown and ochre
- The Djinguereber Mosque with its distinctive minaret and protruding wooden beams (*toron*) used for maintenance
- The Sankore Mosque with its pyramid-shaped minaret, the heart of the scholarly quarter
- Narrow streets, many barely wide enough for a loaded camel, winding between high walls
- The market squares: the salt market where massive slabs from Taghaza are traded, the book market where manuscripts change hands
- Sand encroaching from the north: the eternal struggle between city and desert

*The people:*
- Tuareg warriors: veiled faces, indigo-dyed robes that stain the skin blue, long swords and leather shields
- Songhai cavalry: unarmored or in quilted cotton, carrying iron-tipped lances and composite bows
- The scholars: white robes and turbans, the dress of the learned; prayer beads and leather satchels for manuscripts
- The townspeople: a cosmopolitan mix of Berbers, Arabs, Mande traders, Songhai administrators, Tuareg pastoralists

**Sound:**

*Before the seizure:*
- The call to prayer from Timbuktu's mosques — the familiar rhythm of Islamic city life
- Camel bells in the Tuareg encampment; the bleating of goats
- The murmur of the marketplace: bargaining in Arabic, Tamasheq, Songhai
- Teaching circles in the mosque courtyards: students chanting Quran, masters lecturing

*During the seizure:*
- Hoofbeats on hard ground: the thunder of Songhai cavalry
- War cries: the ululation of attack, the shouted orders of commanders
- The sounds of flight: people running, doors slamming, the chaos of a city changing hands
- Camels bellowing as the Tuareg retreat

*After:*
- Silence in the scholarly quarter: the absence of teaching circles
- The new sounds of occupation: Songhai drums, the voices of conquerors
- Weeping: the mourning of those who lost family, home, or hope
- Later: the sounds of punishment — the whispered rumors, the cries of the condemned

**Smell:**

- Desert dust: the ever-present smell of the Sahara's edge, dry and mineral
- Leather: the Saharan leather trade, the smell of working hides
- Ink and paper: in the scholarly quarters, the smell of manuscript production
- Cooking fires: millet porridge, grilled meat, the smoke of wood fires
- Incense: burned in mosques and in indigenous rituals
- Blood: after the persecutions, the smell that marks violence
- Camel and horse: the animal smell of military camps

**Touch/Feel:**

- Heat: the crushing Sahelian sun, the dry heat of the desert margins
- Sand: gritty between the fingers, in the clothing, in the food
- The smooth surface of a manuscript: the texture of paper or parchment
- The weight of chains: for those imprisoned after the conquest
- The relief of shade: the transition from blazing sun to the cool interior of a mud-brick building

**Taste:**

- Dust: the ever-present taste of the desert
- Millet: the staple grain of the Sahel, prepared as porridge or flat bread
- Dates: the sweet fruit of the Saharan oases, carried by caravans
- Tea: mint tea sweetened with sugar, the Saharan social drink (possibly anachronistic for 1468 — tea trade uncertain)
- Salt: the vital mineral, traded pound for pound against gold
- Fear: the metallic taste of terror in the mouths of those awaiting judgment

### Character Moments

**Sunni Ali entering Timbuktu:**
A conqueror's triumph — riding through the gates of the most famous city in the western Sudan. What does he feel? Pride? Satisfaction? Contempt for the scholars who watch from doorways? The chronicles portray him as hostile to learning, but even a hostile man might feel awe at Timbuktu's reputation. The moment of entry — the threshold between campaign and occupation — is rich with possibility.

**A scholar deciding to collaborate:**
Before Sunni Ali's arrival, during the Tuareg occupation. A man of learning faces a choice: resist and lose his position, or accept Tuareg patronage and continue teaching. He chooses accommodation. His reasoning seems sound at the time; it will condemn him later. The moment of decision — the rationalization, the compromises — humanizes the "collaborators" whom Sunni Ali would punish.

**A scholar deciding to flee:**
After Sunni Ali's victory, the persecution begins. A scholar gathers his manuscripts — as many as he can carry — and prepares to flee to Walata. He leaves behind his home, his students, his position. The moment of departure: looking back at the city, knowing he may never return. The loss is personal; the survival is professional — he will continue teaching elsewhere.

**The messenger (Muhammad Naddi) returning:**
If the invitation was real, Muhammad Naddi traveled to Gao to invite Sunni Ali's intervention. Now he returns with the Songhai army — the man who brought this disaster upon his city. Does he feel responsible for what follows? Does he try to intervene when the persecution begins? His position is uniquely agonizing: he is neither persecutor nor victim, but the man who connected them.

**Akil Ag-Amalwal in retreat:**
The Tuareg chief leads his people into the desert. He has lost Timbuktu — thirty-five years of profitable occupation — but he has preserved his forces. In the desert, the Tuareg are safe. The retreat is bitter but rational. What does he say to his warriors? How does he explain the loss without acknowledging defeat?

### Before the Capture

**Tuareg Timbuktu (1433-1468):**
The city under occupation. The Tuareg extract tribute; the scholars endure. This is the world before Sunni Ali — a world of accommodation, of survival, of waiting for something to change. Scene opportunities:
- A Tuareg chief demanding tribute from a merchant
- A scholar teaching students while Tuareg warriors patrol outside
- The arrival of Muhammad Naddi with news: Sunni Ali has agreed to come

**The invitation (if it happened):**
A secret meeting of scholars debating whether to invite Songhai intervention. Some argue for caution — better the Tuareg you know than the Songhai you don't. Others argue that any change is better than the current oppression. The decision is made; Muhammad Naddi is chosen as messenger. The moment of commitment: setting in motion events that cannot be recalled.

**Sunni Ali receiving the invitation:**
At Gao, in the Songhai capital. The messenger arrives with an offer: Timbuktu invites liberation. Sunni Ali considers: the risks, the rewards, the strategic implications. The decision to march — the beginning of imperial expansion. What does he tell his generals? Does he mention the scholars' invitation or present the campaign as pure conquest?

### During the Capture

**The approach:**
Songhai forces moving through the Sahel toward Timbuktu. The terrain changes as they move northward: greener near the Niger, browner near the desert. Scouts report Tuareg movements. Sunni Ali drives his forces forward — "a single night," the chronicles will claim, though the journey takes longer.

**Tuareg flight:**
Akil Ag-Amalwal learns of the Songhai approach. His forces are inadequate to resist; the population offers no support. He orders retreat. The moment of decision: gathering the warriors, abandoning the city. The Tuareg column moves northward into the desert while Songhai cavalry approaches from the east.

**Entry into the city:**
The gates open — willingly? forcibly? — and Songhai forces enter Timbuktu. The population watches: fear, hope, uncertainty. Sunni Ali rides through the streets to the great mosque. He has taken the most famous city in the western Sudan. What happens next will define his reign.

### After the Capture

**The first confrontation with scholars:**
Sunni Ali meets the Timbuktu ulama. They expect gratitude for their invitation; he sees men who accommodated Tuareg rule. The moment of revelation: when hope turns to fear. The scholars begin to understand that they have not gained a patron but a persecutor.

**The persecution begins:**
A specific scholar — the qadi, perhaps — is brought before Sunni Ali. The charge: collaboration with the Tuareg. The evidence: years of functioning under occupation. The judgment: whatever Sunni Ali decrees. The scene is a trial, but the outcome is predetermined.

**Flight to Walata:**
Scholars flee Timbuktu for safer locations. The journey across the desert: fear of pursuit, the weight of manuscripts carried into exile, the uncertainty of reception at the destination. The refugee experience: everything lost except learning itself.

**A scholar who stays:**
Not all scholars fled; some accommodated the new regime as they had accommodated the old. The calculus of survival: what compromises are necessary? what integrity can be preserved? The man who stays faces a different set of moral challenges than the man who flees.

**Sunni Ali contemplating Timbuktu:**
Alone (or with a trusted advisor), the conqueror considers his prize. The city is his; the scholars hate him; the Tuareg raid from the desert; the empire is beginning to take shape. What does victory feel like? What remains to be done? The internal landscape of the conqueror.

### Worldview and Values

**Sunni Ali's perspective:**
- **Military logic:** The scholars who collaborated with the Tuareg are collaborators, regardless of their reasons. A conqueror who tolerates collaboration invites further collaboration in the future. Punishment is not cruelty but policy.
- **Class perspective:** The scholars claim authority based on learning; Sunni Ali's authority comes from the sword. Their claim to independent judgment threatens his power. He is not obligated to defer to men who cannot defend their own city.
- **Religious ambiguity:** Whether Sunni Ali genuinely preferred indigenous religion or simply refused to privilege Islamic scholars over other advisors, his position challenged the ulama's expectation that rulers should defer to scholarly authority.

**The scholars' perspective:**
- **Innocent suffering:** They had no choice under Tuareg occupation; they did what anyone would do to survive. Punishing them for this accommodation is unjust.
- **Betrayed trust:** If they invited Sunni Ali, they expected gratitude, not persecution. His treatment of them is a betrayal of the bargain.
- **Cultural authority:** They represent learning, civilization, Islam itself. Sunni Ali's attack on them is an attack on these values. His military power cannot make him right.

**Perspectives in tension:**
Fiction can explore how both viewpoints contain truth. The scholars were not simply innocent; some genuinely collaborated. Sunni Ali was not simply cruel; he faced real political challenges. The conflict between them has no clear moral winner — which is why it remains compelling.

### Dialogue Opportunities

**The invitation meeting:**
Scholars debating whether to invite Songhai intervention. Different voices: the cautious, the desperate, the calculating. The decision emerges from argument.

**Sunni Ali's war council:**
The conqueror discussing strategy with his generals. The military calculation: how to take Timbuktu, how to handle the Tuareg, what to do with the scholars.

**The first encounter:**
Sunni Ali meeting the ulama after his victory. The gap in expectations: they expect gratitude; he sees collaborators. The dialogue shifts from welcome to accusation.

**A scholar's defense:**
Brought before Sunni Ali, a scholar argues for his innocence. What does he say? How does he explain his actions under occupation? How does Sunni Ali respond?

**Exile conversations:**
Scholars in Walata discussing what happened, what it means, how to remember. The beginnings of the chronicle tradition — the first telling of the story that will shape historical memory.

## Sources

### Primary Sources

**Tarikh al-Sudan (Abd al-Rahman al-Sa'di, c. 1650)**

The most important source for the capture of Timbuktu. Written approximately 180 years after the event, the *Tarikh al-Sudan* draws on oral tradition, earlier chronicles (now lost), and the institutional memory of Timbuktu's scholarly families. Al-Sa'di provides the basic narrative: the Tuareg occupation, the invitation to Sunni Ali, the capture, and the persecution. His perspective is unmistakably that of the scholarly class.

**Key passages:**
- Description of Tuareg occupation and its oppressive nature
- The invitation sent to Sunni Ali via Muhammad Naddi
- Sunni Ali's rapid movement to Timbuktu
- The persecution of scholars who had collaborated with the Tuareg
- Sunni Ali's alleged hostility to Islamic learning

**Translation:** John Hunwick, *Timbuktu and the Songhay Empire: Al-Sa'di's Ta'rikh al-Sudan down to 1613, and Other Contemporary Documents* (Brill, 1999). This is the standard scholarly translation with extensive annotation.

**Reliability:** Essential primary source but shaped by the Timbuktu scholarly perspective. Al-Sa'di had every reason to present Sunni Ali negatively and the scholars sympathetically. [E for existence and basic narrative; D for characterization and detail]

**Tarikh al-Fattash (Mahmud Kati family, c. 1519-1665)**

A more complex textual situation. Some portions may have been written by Mahmud Kati, who lived during the late Sonni and early Askia periods; other portions were added by his descendants over the following century and a half. The *Tarikh al-Fattash* shares the *Tarikh al-Sudan*'s negative assessment of Sunni Ali and its sympathy for the Timbuktu scholars.

**Key passages:**
- Sunni Ali's religious practices (allegedly syncretic or anti-Islamic)
- Treatment of the Timbuktu ulama
- Contrast with Askia Muhammad's piety

**Translation:** Older French translations exist (O. Houdas & M. Delafosse, *Tarikh el-Fettach*, 1913); no complete modern English translation is available, though excerpts appear in various scholarly works.

**Reliability:** Important supporting source but shares the bias of the *Tarikh al-Sudan*. The textual history creates additional uncertainty about which portions date from near the events and which are later elaborations. [E for importance; D for interpretation]

### Secondary Sources

**Hunwick, John O., *Timbuktu and the Songhay Empire: Al-Sa'di's Ta'rikh al-Sudan down to 1613, and Other Contemporary Documents* (Brill, 1999)**

The standard English-language resource. Hunwick's translation of the *Tarikh al-Sudan* is accompanied by extensive historical introduction and annotation. His notes identify points of uncertainty and scholarly debate. Essential for serious research on the Songhai period.

**Gomez, Michael A., *African Dominion: A New History of Empire in Early and Medieval West Africa* (Princeton, 2018)**

The most recent major synthesis of West African imperial history. Gomez provides fresh analysis of Sunni Ali and the events at Timbuktu, engaging with the historiographical debates about source bias and religious characterization. Strongly recommended for understanding current scholarly thinking.

**Saad, Elias N., *Social History of Timbuktu: The Role of Muslim Scholars and Notables, 1400-1900* (Cambridge, 1983)**

Valuable for understanding the scholarly class with whom Sunni Ali clashed. Saad analyzes the social position, institutions, and worldview of Timbuktu's ulama, providing context for their conflict with the Songhai military establishment.

**Levtzion, Nehemia, *Ancient Ghana and Mali* (Methuen, 1973)**

Though focused primarily on the earlier empires, Levtzion provides essential context for understanding the world Sunni Ali inherited — the decline of Mali and the power vacuum that allowed Songhai's rise.

### Source Assessment

The evidence for the capture of Timbuktu is relatively rich by medieval African standards but entirely filtered through sources with strong perspectives. We know more about this event than many in African history, but everything we know comes from chroniclers who had reason to frame the story in particular ways.

**What is well-established [E]:**
- Sunni Ali captured Timbuktu from the Tuareg in 1468
- The Tuareg chief Akil Ag-Amalwal fled into the desert
- Timbuktu was incorporated into the Songhai Empire
- Some degree of conflict existed between Sunni Ali and the Timbuktu scholars

**What is probable [P]:**
- The capture was swift rather than prolonged
- Some scholars were punished for collaboration with the Tuareg
- The persecution created lasting enmity between Sunni Ali and the ulama

**What is debated [D]:**
- The invitation from Timbuktu's scholars
- The scale and nature of the persecution
- Sunni Ali's motivations (religious hostility vs. political calculation)
- The reliability of specific details in the chronicle accounts

**What is speculative or traditional [S/T]:**
- Specific speeches and statements attributed to Sunni Ali
- The claim that he traveled from Gao to Timbuktu "in a single night"
- Details that fit too neatly into the chronicle's moral framework

For fiction purposes, the gaps are opportunities. The sources provide a framework — the capture, the persecution, the lasting conflict — within which a writer can construct characters, motivations, and scenes. The moral ambiguity that troubles historians offers dramatic possibility: the same events can be told from Sunni Ali's perspective, from the scholars' perspective, or from the perspective of someone caught between them.
