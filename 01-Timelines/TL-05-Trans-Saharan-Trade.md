# TL-05: Trans-Saharan Trade Timeline
## The Gold-Salt Exchange and Its Transformations (~300-1600 CE)

*Thematic timeline tracing the evolution of trans-Saharan trade — the economic engine that powered the great Sahel empires. The exchange of gold from West African forests for Saharan salt, North African manufactured goods, and (increasingly) Islamic culture created one of the medieval world's most consequential trade networks.*

## Overview

The trans-Saharan trade was not a single route but a network of paths crossing the world's largest desert, linking the Mediterranean and North Africa to the Sahel belt of West Africa. Key commodities:

- **Northbound:** Gold (the primary driver), slaves, ivory, kola nuts, hides
- **Southbound:** Salt (from Saharan mines at Taghaza, Idjil), manufactured goods (textiles, metalware, horses), books, and Islamic religious/intellectual culture
- **The gold-salt equation:** West Africa had gold but little salt; the Sahara had salt mines but no gold. This complementarity drove centuries of trade.

The trade made empires. Control of the exchange points — where gold met salt, where desert met savanna — was the foundation of Ghana, Mali, and Songhai's power.

## Timeline

| Date | Event | Confidence |
|------|-------|------------|
| c. 300 BCE-300 CE | **Camel domestication and adoption** in the Sahara. The camel (introduced from Arabia, probably before 200 BCE) gradually replaces the horse and ox for desert transport, making regular trans-Saharan crossings feasible. | [P] |
| c. 300-500 | **Trans-Saharan trade routes begin to regularize.** Small-scale exchange of gold, salt, and other goods across the desert. The Soninke people (ancestors of Ghana/Wagadu) position themselves at the southern terminus. | [P] |
| c. 500-700 | **Trade volume increases.** Gold from West African alluvial deposits (Bambouk, Bure) flows north; Saharan salt flows south. Staging oases — Audaghost, Sijilmasa, Walata — develop as caravan stops. | [P] |
| c. 700-800 | **Islamic conquest of North Africa** creates a vast, connected market for West African gold. The Umayyad and Abbasid caliphates' demand for gold coinage stimulates the trans-Saharan gold trade enormously. | [E] |
| c. 700-800 | **Ghana (Wagadu) consolidates control** of the southern trade termini. The Soninke state taxes gold passing through its territory, accumulating enormous wealth without directly mining the gold. | [P] |
| c. 800s | **Sijilmasa** in southern Morocco develops as the primary northern terminus of the trans-Saharan routes. | [E] |
| c. 800s | **Audaghost** (Tegdaoust) flourishes as a Saharan staging post and trading town. Described later by al-Bakri as a prosperous oasis town. | [P] |
| c. 800-1000 | **"Silent trade" tradition.** Arabic sources describe a practice where gold producers and traders exchanged goods without direct contact — gold left at a designated place, salt left in exchange. Whether this actually happened as described is [Debated] — it may reflect outsiders' misunderstanding of the Wangara traders' protection of their gold sources' locations. | [D] |
| c. 900-1000 | **Wangara traders** (Mande-speaking gold merchants) dominate the middleman role. They controlled the flow of gold from the forest-zone producers to the Sahel trading centers, fiercely protecting the secrecy of gold sources. | [P] |
| c. 1000 | **West African gold is the primary gold supply for the Islamic world** and, indirectly, for Europe. An estimated two-thirds of the Old World's gold supply comes from West Africa. | [P] |
| 1054 | **Almoravid movement emerges** among Saharan Sanhaja Berbers. Religious reform movement that will reshape trans-Saharan politics and trade. The Almoravids control Audaghost and Sijilmasa. | [E] |
| 1068 | **al-Bakri describes Ghana's wealth** from trans-Saharan trade. The king of Ghana taxes gold and salt passing through his territory. The gold trade is the foundation of state power. | [E] |
| c. 1076 | **Almoravid pressure on Ghana.** Whether or not Almoravids militarily conquered Koumbi Saleh, their control of the northern and Saharan portions of the trade network challenges Ghana's monopoly position. | [D] |
| c. 1100-1200 | **Ghana's decline shifts trade patterns.** New routes develop; new political powers compete for control. The Sosso kingdom briefly dominates, then falls to Mali. | [P] |
| c. 1235+ | **Mali Empire captures the trade network.** Sundiata and his successors control the gold-salt trade routes more extensively than Ghana ever did, extending authority over both the goldfields (Bambouk, Bure) and the Saharan salt sources. | [P] |
| c. 1250-1350 | **Timbuktu and Djenne become major trade hubs.** Timbuktu: where the desert meets the Niger River; staging point for Saharan caravans. Djenne: on the Niger's inland delta; collection point for forest-zone gold. | [E] |
| c. 1300s | **Taghaza salt mines** in the central Sahara produce enormous quantities of rock salt. Slabs of salt are the currency of the trans-Saharan trade. Conditions at Taghaza are terrible — enslaved miners work in extreme heat. Ibn Battuta describes it as "an unattractive village" entirely built of salt. | [E] |
| 1324-1325 | **Mansa Musa's hajj demonstrates Mali's gold wealth to the world.** His lavish spending in Cairo causes gold inflation lasting a decade. The Catalan Atlas (1375) will depict him holding a gold nugget. | [E] |
| 1352-1353 | **Ibn Battuta travels the trans-Saharan route.** His account describes the journey: departure from Sijilmasa, crossing of the desert via Taghaza, arrival at Walata, journey to the Mali capital. Vivid detail on caravans, dangers, and trade practices. | [E] |
| c. 1400s | **Juula (Dyula) trading diaspora expands.** Mande-speaking Muslim merchants establish trading networks deep into the forest zone, bringing gold north and Islam south. They create a web of trading communities across West Africa. | [P] |
| 1464+ | **Songhai captures the trade network.** Sunni Ali's conquests bring Timbuktu, Djenne, and the middle Niger under Songhai control. The empire controls the greatest extent of the trans-Saharan trade routes yet. | [E] |
| c. 1470s-1490s | **Portuguese establish coastal trade posts** on the West African Atlantic coast (Elmina, 1482). Gold begins to flow west to the Atlantic as well as north across the Sahara. The trans-Saharan trade faces its first structural competition. | [E] |
| c. 1500s | **Trans-Saharan trade continues** but the Atlantic route provides an alternative. Gold now flows in two directions. The relative importance of the trans-Saharan route begins a slow, century-long decline. | [P] |
| 1526 | **Leo Africanus describes Timbuktu's trade.** "Here are many shops of artificers and merchants, and especially of such as weave linen and cotton cloth... Here are great store of doctors, judges, priests, and other learned men, that are bountifully maintained at the king's cost. And hither are brought diverse manuscripts or written books out of Barbary, which are sold for more money than any other merchandise." | [E] |
| 1591 | **Battle of Tondibi — Moroccan invasion.** Sultan Ahmad al-Mansur of Morocco sends an army across the Sahara specifically to seize control of the trans-Saharan gold trade (and the Taghaza salt mines). The Songhai Empire is destroyed. Ironically, the Moroccans find that controlling the gold trade from the north does not work — the gold comes from the southern forest zone, which they cannot reach. | [E] |
| 1591-1600+ | **Post-Tondibi disruption.** The Moroccan conquest destabilizes the entire trade network. The Arma (Moroccan settlers) control Timbuktu and Gao but cannot replicate Songhai's effective management of trade. Trans-Saharan commerce continues but never fully recovers. | [E] |
