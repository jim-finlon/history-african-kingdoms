## Sub-Saharan African Kingdoms — Chronological Documents Directory

*Navigation hub for all timeline documents. Timelines are organized in two groups: regional (covering all events in a geographic area) and thematic (tracing a specific phenomenon across regions).*

## How to Use These Timelines

- **For a broad overview:** Start with [[TL-00-Master-Timeline]], then drill into regional timelines for detail
- **For a specific region:** Go directly to the relevant regional timeline
- **For trade or religion:** Use the thematic timelines, which trace phenomena across regions
- **For kingdom overlaps:** See [[00-Reference/Chronological-Framework]] for a visual chart of contemporaneous kingdoms
- **For specific events or figures:** Cross-references within each timeline link to prosopography and battle entries

## Confidence System

All timeline events are marked with confidence levels:

| Code | Level | Meaning |
|------|-------|---------|
| [E] | Established | Multiple independent sources; scholarly consensus |
| [P] | Probable | At least one reliable source; majority view |
| [D] | Debated | Active scholarly disagreement |
| [S] | Speculative | Scholarly inference without direct evidence |
| [T] | Traditional/Oral | From oral tradition; may contain historical kernel |
