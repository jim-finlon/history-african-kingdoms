| West Africa | ~75 | 1200-1600 CE (Arabic sources, oral tradition) |
| Horn of Africa | ~40 | 300-600 CE (Aksumite inscriptions), 1270-1600 CE (Ge'ez chronicles) |
| East Africa | ~15 | 1200-1600 CE (Arabic accounts, archaeology, Portuguese sources) |
| Southern Africa | ~12 | 1075-1500 CE (archaeology, limited oral tradition) |

| Cross-regional | ~10 | Various |

**Note on imbalance:** The event count reflects source availability, not historical importance. Southern Africa's kingdoms were as sophisticated as any listed here; their relative silence in this timeline reflects the paucity of written and oral records, not the absence of history. See [[00-Reference/Archaeological-Sites-Index]] for the material evidence.
