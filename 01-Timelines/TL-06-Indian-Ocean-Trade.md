# TL-06: Indian Ocean Trade Timeline
## East Africa and the Maritime World (~300-1600 CE)

*Thematic timeline tracing East Africa's participation in the Indian Ocean trade network — one of the oldest and most extensive maritime trading systems in world history. The monsoon winds connected the Swahili Coast to Arabia, Persia, India, Southeast Asia, and China.*

## Overview

The Indian Ocean trade system was driven by the monsoon winds:
- **Northeast monsoon** (November-March): Carried ships south and west from India and Arabia to East Africa
- **Southwest monsoon** (April-September): Carried ships north and east from Africa to Arabia and India

This annual rhythm structured the entire economic, social, and cultural life of the Swahili Coast. Ships arrived with the northeast monsoon, traded for months, and departed with the southwest monsoon.

**East African exports:** Gold (from Zimbabwe Plateau), ivory, iron, mangrove poles (for treeless Arabia), slaves, ambergris, rock crystal, leopard skins, tortoiseshell
**East African imports:** Textiles (Indian cloth, silk), ceramics (Chinese porcelain, Persian pottery), glass beads (Indian), metalware, spices

## Timeline

| Date | Event | Confidence |
|------|-------|------------|
| c. 1st century CE | ***Periplus of the Erythraean Sea*** describes trade with the East African coast ("Azania"). Roman, Arabian, and Indian goods reach Africa; African ivory, tortoiseshell, and spices flow outward. Establishes that Indian Ocean trade with East Africa predates our project period by centuries. | [E] |
| c. 300-500 | **Limited evidence of ongoing trade.** The collapse of the Western Roman Empire reduces Mediterranean demand, but Arabian and Persian Gulf trade with East Africa likely continues at reduced levels. | [S] |
| c. 500-600 | **Aksumite participation in Red Sea trade.** The kingdom of Aksum (via the port of Adulis) is a major player in the western Indian Ocean, trading with the Byzantine Empire, Arabia, and India. | [E] |
| c. 600-700 | **Rise of Islam transforms Indian Ocean trade.** The Muslim caliphates create a vast connected market from Spain to Central Asia. Arabian and Persian Gulf merchants intensify trade with East Africa. | [E] |
| c. 700-800 | **East African coast integrated into the Islamic trade network.** Muslim merchants establish residence in Swahili Coast towns. Goods begin flowing in greater quantities. | [P] |
| c. 800-900 | **Indian Ocean trade intensifies.** East African settlements grow. Glass beads from India, ceramics from the Persian Gulf, and other trade goods appear in increasing quantities at archaeological sites. | [E] |
| c. 900s | **Dhow construction and monsoon navigation** are fully developed. The lateen-rigged dhow becomes the standard vessel for Indian Ocean trade. East African mangrove poles are a crucial export — used for construction in the treeless Arabian Peninsula. | [P] |
| c. 947 | **al-Mas'udi describes the "Land of Zanj"** and its trade. Mentions gold, ivory, and other exports. Notes that "Zanj" merchants sailed to Oman and other Arabian ports. | [E] |
| c. 1000-1100 | **Gold trade from Zimbabwe Plateau** begins to flow through the port of Sofala (Mozambique) to Kilwa and thence to the wider Indian Ocean world. This gold trade will make Kilwa the wealthiest Swahili city-state. | [P] |
| c. 1000-1200 | **Chinese goods appear on the Swahili Coast.** Song dynasty ceramics found at Kilwa, Shanga, and other sites. Trade probably indirect — Chinese goods reach East Africa via Indian and Arabian intermediaries. | [E] |
| c. 1100-1300 | **Peak of Swahili Coast participation in Indian Ocean trade.** Multiple prosperous city-states. Kilwa dominates the southern gold trade; Mogadishu dominates the northern routes. | [E] |
| c. 1200 | **Kilwa controls the Sofala trade route.** By gaining authority over or alliance with Sofala, Kilwa monopolizes the export of Zimbabwe Plateau gold to the Indian Ocean world. This is the foundation of its extraordinary wealth. | [P] |
| c. 1200-1400 | **Chinese porcelain in great quantities** at Swahili sites. Yuan and early Ming dynasty ceramics. Some scholars suggest this indicates direct Chinese trade contacts; most believe it was mediated through Arabian and Indian merchants. | [E] for ceramics presence; [D] for direct vs. indirect trade |
| c. 1310-1333 | **Husuni Kubwa palace built at Kilwa** — physical evidence of the wealth generated by Indian Ocean trade. The palace's scale, luxury, and imported materials demonstrate Kilwa's position as a major Indian Ocean commercial hub. | [P] |
| 1331 | **Ibn Battuta describes Kilwa's trade** and praises its prosperity. His account shows a city deeply integrated into the Indian Ocean world — Muslim, cosmopolitan, wealthy from maritime commerce. | [E] |
| 1405-1433 | **Ming dynasty "treasure voyages"** under Zheng He. At least one expedition (possibly the 5th voyage, 1417-1419) may have reached the East African coast. A Chinese giraffe reportedly brought back from "Malindi" or a nearby East African port. Whether Zheng He personally visited East Africa is [Debated]. | [D] |
| c. 1450-1498 | **Indian Ocean trade continues** but Kilwa's position weakens. Political instability, competition, and possible shifts in gold production affect trade patterns. | [P] |
| 1498 | **Vasco da Gama reaches the East African coast.** The Portuguese arrival begins the disruption of the Indian Ocean trade system that had functioned for centuries. Da Gama is astonished by the wealth and sophistication of Swahili Coast cities — these are not the "primitive" settlements Europeans expected. | [E] |
| 1500-1510 | **Portuguese violent entry into the Indian Ocean trade system.** Bombardment and sacking of Kilwa (1505), Mombasa (1505), and other cities. The Portuguese aim to monopolize Indian Ocean trade, seizing control of strategic ports and trade routes by force. | [E] |
| 1505 | **Kilwa sacked by Portuguese.** The gold trade route — Zimbabwe Plateau → Sofala → Kilwa → Indian Ocean — is seized by Portugal. Kilwa never recovers its former prosperity. | [E] |
| c. 1510-1530 | **Portuguese establish *Estado da Índia*** — a string of forts and factories controlling key Indian Ocean chokepoints. Sofala, Mozambique Island, Hormuz, Goa, and Malacca. The integrated Indian Ocean trade system is fractured into Portuguese-controlled segments. | [E] |
| c. 1530-1600 | **Swahili Coast trade continues but under Portuguese shadow.** Some cities cooperate; others resist. The free-flowing, multi-directional trade network gives way to a more centralized, Portuguese-mediated system. But Portuguese control is never total — smuggling, unofficial trade, and resistance continue. | [E] |
| 1588 | **Ottoman-allied expedition to the Swahili Coast.** Mir Ali Bey attempts to organize Swahili resistance against the Portuguese with Ottoman support. Demonstrates that the Indian Ocean trade system's other powers recognize what has been lost. | [E] |
| 1593 | **Fort Jesus built at Mombasa.** The massive Portuguese fortress symbolizes the militarization of Indian Ocean trade — what had been a network of voluntary commercial exchange is now maintained (in part) by force. | [E] |

## The Gold Route

The single most important trade route in East African history:

```
Zimbabwe Plateau goldfields
        ↓ (overland, via intermediary traders)
Sofala (coastal outlet, Mozambique)
        ↓ (by sea)
Kilwa Kisiwani (entrepôt, Tanzania)
        ↓ (by sea, monsoon-driven)
Aden / Hormuz / Western India
        ↓ (onward distribution)
Cairo / Baghdad / Delhi / Chinese markets (via intermediaries)
```

This route made Kilwa the wealthiest Swahili city-state and connected the Zimbabwe Plateau — whose rulers may never have seen the ocean — to markets in China.
