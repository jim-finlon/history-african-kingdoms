**A note on sources:** West Africa's written record before c. 1000 CE is extremely thin. For the early centuries, we rely primarily on archaeology, oral tradition, and occasional Arabic geographic references. The richest period for written sources is c. 1068-1600 CE, when Arabic chronicles, oral epics, and eventually European accounts provide complementary perspectives. Oral tradition, particularly the Sundiata epic and the Dausi, is treated here as legitimate primary evidence subject to the same source criticism as written accounts. See [[00-Reference/Bibliography]] for full source assessments.

## 4th Century (300-399 CE)

| Date | Event | Polity/Region | Confidence |
|------|-------|---------------|------------|
| c. 300s | **Wagadu (Ghana) state formation among the Soninke.** Oral tradition preserved in the Dausi epic places the origins of the Wagadu state in this general period. The Soninke people, occupying the Sahel zone between the upper Niger and Senegal rivers, begin to consolidate political authority over trade routes connecting the gold-producing regions to the south with the salt-bearing Sahara to the north. No written sources survive from this period; knowledge rests on oral tradition and limited archaeological inference. | GHA | [S] |
| c. 300s | **Nok terracotta tradition in its final phases in central Nigeria.** The Nok culture, active since c. 1500 BCE, produced sophisticated terracotta sculptures that represent the earliest known figurative art in sub-Saharan Africa. By the late Nok period, the culture is declining, but its artistic legacy may have influenced the later Yoruba (Ife) and Edo (Benin) sculptural traditions. Archaeological dating suggests Nok production ceases by c. 200-500 CE. | YOR/OTH | [P] |
| c. 300s | **Iron-smelting and agricultural communities expanding across the West African savanna and forest zones.** The spread of iron technology, underway for centuries, enables more intensive agriculture, forest clearance, and the accumulation of surplus that will later support state formation in the forest belt. | OTH | [P] |

## 5th Century (400-499 CE)

| Date | Event | Polity/Region | Confidence |
|------|-------|---------------|------------|
| c. 400s | **Wagadu continues to consolidate.** The Dausi epic places the kingdom's early growth in this general period, under the protection of the serpent Bida, whose annual sacrifice ensured the kingdom's gold wealth. This mythology encodes the relationship between political authority and control of gold production. No written sources confirm the kingdom's existence before Arabic references in the 8th century. | GHA | [T] |
| c. 450 | **End of the Nok terracotta tradition.** The cultural complex centered in the Jos Plateau region of modern Nigeria ceases to produce its distinctive sculptures. The relationship between Nok and later Yoruba/Ife art remains an active area of archaeological investigation. See [[00-Reference/Archaeological-Sites-Index]]. | YOR/OTH | [P] |
| c. 400-500s | **Early development of the Inland Niger Delta settlement complex.** Archaeological evidence from Jenne-Jeno (Djenne-Djeno) and related sites shows growing population density and economic specialization in the inland delta of the Niger River, which will become one of West Africa's most important economic zones. | OTH | [P] |

## 6th Century (500-599 CE)

| Date | Event | Polity/Region | Confidence |
|------|-------|---------------|------------|
| c. 500s | **Trans-Saharan trade routes becoming increasingly active.** The adoption of the camel (introduced to the Sahara centuries earlier) enables more regular and larger-scale commerce across the desert. Gold from the Bambuk and Bure goldfields in the upper Niger and Senegal river regions begins to reach North Africa and the Mediterranean in growing quantities. The Soninke of Wagadu are positioned at the southern terminus of these routes. | GHA/OTH | [P] |
| c. 500s | **Jenne-Jeno growing as an urban center.** Archaeological evidence shows the settlement expanding, with specialized craft production (iron-smelting, pottery) and evidence of long-distance trade contacts. Jenne-Jeno challenges European assumptions about African urbanism by demonstrating that cities could develop in West Africa without external stimulus. | OTH | [E] |
| c. 500-600s | **Wagadu's ruling dynasty, the Cisse (or Sissay) clan, consolidating power.** The title "Ghana" (warrior king) is associated with the Soninke ruler; Arabic sources will later adopt this title as the name for the entire state. Internal governance likely based on a combination of kinship authority, control of trade, and religious legitimation tied to the Bida serpent cult. | GHA | [T] |

## 7th Century (600-699 CE)

| Date | Event | Polity/Region | Confidence |
|------|-------|---------------|------------|
| c. 600s | **Kanem state begins to form around Lake Chad.** Under the Zaghawa and early Sayfawa dynasty, a polity emerges in the Lake Chad basin controlling trade routes that connect the central Sahel to North Africa (the Fezzan corridor). The origins of the Sayfawa dynasty are debated, with some traditions placing its founding as early as the 9th century. | KB | [S] |
| c. 600s | **Wagadu (Ghana) expanding into a major regional power.** The Soninke state grows in strength, controlling the vital exchange point where gold from the south meets salt from the Saharan mines of Taghaza and Idjil. The earliest Arabic geographical references to "Ghana" appear in the following century. | GHA | [P] |
| c. 622+ | **Islam's emergence in Arabia begins a transformation that will reshape West Africa over coming centuries.** While direct impact on West Africa lies centuries ahead, the rise of Islam creates the trans-Saharan commercial and intellectual networks through which Islamic faith, literacy, and law will eventually reach the Sahel. Arab conquest of North Africa (640s-710s) brings Muslim traders and scholars to the northern termini of the trans-Saharan routes. | OTH | [E] |
| c. 600-700s | **Gao emerges as a small trading settlement on the Niger Bend.** The site that will later become the capital of the Songhai Empire begins as a modest settlement linked to trans-Saharan trade. Early Songhai-speaking communities are present in the region, though the founding of the Za (Dia) dynasty that tradition associates with Gao is dated later. | SON | [S] |

## 8th Century (700-799 CE)

| Date | Event | Polity/Region | Confidence |
|------|-------|---------------|------------|
| c. 700s | **Ghana Empire recognized as a major power by Arabic geographers.** The earliest Arabic references describe a wealthy kingdom controlling the gold trade. The astronomer al-Fazari (d. c. 796-806) is among the first to mention "Ghana" in writing, calling it the "land of gold." These references confirm that by the 8th century, Wagadu was significant enough to reach the awareness of scholars in Baghdad. | GHA | [E] |
| c. 700s | **Jenne-Jeno at or near its urban peak.** Archaeological evidence from Roderick McIntosh's excavations suggests a population that may have reached 20,000 or more in the broader settlement cluster. The site demonstrates a "heterarchical" form of urbanism — multiple specialized communities clustered together without a single dominant center or monumental architecture, challenging the assumption that cities require centralized authority. | OTH | [P] |
| c. 700s | **Trans-Saharan gold-salt trade developing into a structured commercial system.** Regular caravans traverse the desert, carrying salt from the Saharan mines south and gold north. The exchange takes place at trading towns along the Sahel, with the Ghana Empire positioned to tax and regulate the flow. North African and Berber merchants operate the northern routes; Soninke and Wangara traders control the southern goldfield connections. | GHA/OTH | [P] |
| c. 700s | **Kanem consolidates under the Sayfawa dynasty.** The state expands its control of trans-Saharan trade routes east of Lake Chad. Gradual Islamization of the ruling elite begins through contact with North African and Saharan traders. The exact chronology of early Sayfawa rulers is uncertain. | KB | [P] |
| c. 750-800 | **Songhai tradition records the Za (Dia) dynasty at Gao.** According to the *Tarikh al-Sudan* (written in the 17th century), the Za dynasty ruled the early Songhai state. The historicity and dating of early Za rulers is uncertain, but the tradition preserves a memory of Songhai political organization predating the imperial period. | SON | [T] |

## 9th Century (800-899 CE)

| Date | Event | Polity/Region | Confidence |
|------|-------|---------------|------------|
| c. 800s | **Igbo-Ukwu: Remarkable 9th-century site in southeastern Nigeria.** Excavated by Thurstan Shaw in the 1950s-60s, Igbo-Ukwu reveals a burial chamber, a storehouse of regalia, and a disposal pit containing sophisticated lost-wax bronze-cast objects and over 100,000 imported glass beads (probably from India or the Middle East via trans-Saharan trade). This demonstrates that southeastern Nigerian communities had both advanced metallurgical skills and long-distance trade connections centuries before European contact. | OTH | [E] |
| c. 800s | **Ife (Ile-Ife) begins to develop as a major Yoruba urban and cultural center.** The sacred city of Yoruba tradition, considered the place where the world was created, begins to take shape as an important settlement. Archaeological evidence places Ife's development in this general period, though the famous naturalistic sculptures come later (c. 1000-1400 CE). | YOR | [P] |
| c. 800s | **Ghana Empire at full strength.** The Soninke state controls the vital Saharan trade routes between the gold-producing south (Bambuk and Bure goldfields) and the salt-producing north (Taghaza, Idjil). The capital, possibly at Koumbi Saleh, serves as the main exchange center. Ghana's rulers maintain religious pluralism, practicing indigenous Soninke religion while tolerating Muslim merchant communities. | GHA | [P] |
| c. 800s | **Islam spreading among trans-Saharan merchant communities in the Sahel.** Muslim traders establish resident communities in the commercial towns along the southern edge of the Sahara. At Ghana's capital, according to later Arabic accounts, the Muslim quarter was separate from the royal quarter. Islam at this stage is primarily a merchant religion in West Africa; the ruling elites largely maintain indigenous faiths. | GHA/OTH | [P] |
| c. 800s | **Songhai at Gao developing trade connections.** Gao participates in the eastern branch of the trans-Saharan trade, linking the Niger Bend to the Fezzan and eventually to Ifriqiya (Tunisia/Libya). Archaeological evidence at Gao-Saney shows imported goods from this period. | SON | [P] |
| c. 800s | **"Silent trade" (dumb barter) tradition along the gold frontier.** Arabic sources describe a form of trade between Sahel merchants and forest-zone gold producers conducted without direct personal contact — goods are laid out and exchanged without the parties meeting face to face. Whether this represents an actual trading practice or a literary convention in Arabic geographic writing is debated, but it reflects the mystery surrounding the gold-producing regions, whose exact locations the Soninke and Wangara merchants closely guarded. | GHA/OTH | [D] |

## 10th Century (900-999 CE)

| Date | Event | Polity/Region | Confidence |
|------|-------|---------------|------------|
| c. 900s | **Kanem becomes formally Islamic.** Mai Hume (or Hawwa) is traditionally credited with the adoption of Islam by the ruling Sayfawa dynasty. The conversion was likely a gradual process driven by trade contacts with North Africa rather than a single event. Kanem's Islamization positions it within the broader Dar al-Islam, facilitating diplomatic and commercial relations. | KB | [T] |
| c. 985 | **Al-Muhallabi provides early Arabic description of Kanem.** He describes a powerful kingdom east of Lake Chad whose ruler is revered quasi-divine authority, suggesting pre-Islamic sacral kingship traditions still operating alongside the relatively new Islamic faith. | KB | [P] |
| c. 900s | **Ghana's influence extends across a wide area of the western Sahel.** The empire collects tribute and taxes trade across a territory stretching from the Senegal River to the Niger Bend. Subject peoples include Berber traders in the north and various Mande and non-Mande groups in the south. The state's wealth is based on controlling the gold-salt exchange rather than directly mining gold. | GHA | [P] |
| c. 900s | **Gao's first Islamic tombstones.** Royal tombstones at Gao-Saney, inscribed in Arabic, date from the late 9th to 12th centuries. The earliest suggest that Islam had reached the Songhai ruling class by this period, though the extent of Islamization is debated. These are some of the earliest epigraphy in the western Sahel. | SON | [E] |
| c. 900-1000s | **Hausa city-states beginning to emerge.** Archaeological and oral traditions suggest that the urban centers of Hausaland — Kano, Katsina, Zazzau (Zaria), Daura, Gobir, Rano, and Biram — are taking shape as significant settlements in this period. The Bayajidda legend, which provides a common origin story for the Hausa "legitimate seven" states, probably reflects later political ideology more than historical migration. | HAU | [T] |
| c. 900s | **Gold-salt exchange becomes the dominant trans-Saharan commercial pattern.** The basic structure of the trade is now well established: gold from the forest-zone goldfields of Bambuk (upper Senegal) and Bure (upper Niger) is carried northward by Wangara (Soninke/Mande) merchants to the Sahel, where it is exchanged for Saharan rock salt (from Taghaza, Idjil, and other mines), North African manufactured goods, and horses. This commercial system — with Ghana positioned at the vital exchange point — generates the wealth that sustains the Sahel empires. | GHA/OTH | [P] |

## 11th Century (1000-1099 CE)

| Date | Event | Polity/Region | Confidence |
|------|-------|---------------|------------|
| c. 1000s | **Ife reaches its artistic peak.** The famous naturalistic bronze and terracotta portrait heads — among the most remarkable achievements in the global history of sculpture — are produced at Ife during this and the following centuries (c. 1000-1400 CE). Cast using the lost-wax (cire perdue) technique, the Ife heads display a naturalism and technical mastery that astonished European art historians when they were first studied in the early 20th century. | YOR | [P] |
| 1054 | **Almoravid movement begins among Saharan Sanhaja Berbers.** Inspired by the preaching of the Maliki jurist Ibn Yasin, the Almoravids launch a reform movement from a ribat (religious fortress) on an island in the Senegal River. They will reshape the political landscape of both West Africa and the Maghreb. | OTH | [E] |
| 1062 | **Almoravids conquer Morocco and begin building an empire.** While expanding northward (they will eventually take Marrakesh, Fez, and parts of Spain), the Almoravids also exert pressure southward toward the Ghana Empire. Their control of the northern termini of the trans-Saharan routes gives them leverage over the Sahelian trade system. | OTH | [E] |
| 1068 | **Al-Bakri writes the *Kitab al-Masalik wa-l-Mamalik* (*Book of Routes and Realms*).** Writing from Cordoba and relying on merchants' reports, the Andalusian geographer provides the most detailed early description of the Ghana Empire: the dual-city capital (a royal town and a separate Muslim commercial quarter about 10 km apart), the king's elaborate court ceremonies, the gold trade, the practice of burying the dead with food and drink, and the religious pluralism of the kingdom. Al-Bakri never visited West Africa himself, but his sources were generally reliable. This text is the single most important written source for the Ghana Empire. See [[08-Primary-Sources/Sources-Index]]. | GHA | [E] |
| c. 1062-1076 | **Reign of Tunka Manin, last great ruler of Ghana.** Described by al-Bakri as presiding over a magnificent court where he held audiences in a domed pavilion, surrounded by horses with gold trappings, pages bearing gold-mounted swords, and sons of vassal kings as hostages/courtiers. He administered justice in public audiences, demonstrating a sophisticated royal judicial system. Al-Bakri's account reveals a powerful, wealthy, and administratively complex state. | GHA | [P] |
| c. 1076 | **Almoravid pressure on Ghana.** The nature of this event is one of the most significant debates in West African historiography. The traditional narrative, based on older scholarship, describes a military conquest of Koumbi Saleh by Almoravid forces in 1076. More recent scholars (notably David Conrad and Humphrey Fisher) have questioned whether a direct military conquest occurred at all, arguing instead for a more gradual process of political pressure, trade disruption, and Islamization. The evidence is genuinely ambiguous. What is clear is that Ghana's power was weakened during this period, and Islam gained greater influence at the court. | GHA | [D] |
| c. 1000-1100 | **Jenne-Jeno begins to decline as an urban center.** The great settlement complex of the Inland Niger Delta, which had been occupied for over a millennium, shows evidence of population decline. The reasons are debated: shifting trade routes, environmental change, or the rise of nearby Djenne (the Muslim successor city) may all have played roles. Roderick McIntosh has argued that the population shift from Jenne-Jeno to Djenne represents the displacement of an indigenous urban tradition by an Islamic commercial one. | OTH | [D] |
| c. 1000-1100s | **Kano Chronicle records the early development of the Kano city-state.** The chronicle (compiled much later, probably in the 17th century) provides king lists and brief narratives for this period. While the specific dates are unreliable, the chronicle preserves a tradition of gradual urbanization, iron-working, and the development of dye-pit textile production that would become Kano's hallmark. | HAU | [T] |
| c. 1000s | **Wangara (Dyula/Juula) trading diaspora expanding across West Africa.** Mande-speaking Muslim merchants establish trading communities across the Sahel and gradually into the forest zone, carrying Islam along commercial networks. The Wangara are one of the primary vectors for Islam's spread beyond the Sahel trading cities into areas that the great Arabic chroniclers never visited. Their commercial practices and religious identity will become intertwined. | OTH | [P] |

## 12th Century (1100-1199 CE)

| Date | Event | Polity/Region | Confidence |
|------|-------|---------------|------------|
| c. 1100s | **Ghana Empire in terminal decline.** Following the Almoravid disruption (whether military or political), the Soninke state loses its ability to control the trans-Saharan trade routes. Successor states and rival polities — particularly the Sosso (Susu) kingdom and emerging Mande groups — compete for control of the western Sahel. The remnants of Ghana will persist as a reduced polity until absorbed by Mali in c. 1240. | GHA | [P] |
| c. 1100s | **Sumanguru Kante rises to power as king of Sosso.** Filling the power vacuum left by Ghana's decline, Sumanguru, a Soninke blacksmith-king of the Kante clan, establishes control over the western Sahel. According to oral tradition, he is a feared sorcerer (*donso*) who oppresses the Mande peoples, killing the sons of rival clans and ruling through terror and magical power. His association with the blacksmith caste connects him to *nyama* (spiritual energy) in Mande cosmology. | MAL/OTH | [T] |
| c. 1100s | **Djenne (the Muslim city) rising to prominence alongside declining Jenne-Jeno.** As the older, indigenous urban complex declines, the newer Muslim-influenced town of Djenne grows as a commercial and religious center. Djenne will become one of the most important trading cities in the western Sahel, famous for its mud-brick architecture and as a center of Islamic learning second only to Timbuktu. | OTH | [P] |
| 1154 | **Al-Idrisi compiles his geography for King Roger II of Sicily.** His *Nuzhat al-Mushtaq* includes descriptions of West African regions, trade routes, and peoples. While less detailed than al-Bakri for Ghana specifically, al-Idrisi provides important geographic context and evidence that knowledge of West African kingdoms circulated widely in the Mediterranean world. | OTH | [E] |
| c. 1180 | **Traditional founding date of the Kingdom of Benin.** The Edo people of the forest zone in modern southern Nigeria establish a kingdom. The Oranmiyan tradition holds that Benin's current royal dynasty traces its origins to a prince from Ife who was invited to rule Benin, linking the two kingdoms. This foundation narrative likely reflects real cultural and political connections between Ife and Benin, though the details are debated. The pre-dynastic period, under rulers titled Ogiso ("rulers of the sky"), may extend further back. | BEN | [T] |
| c. 1100-1200 | **Kanem expanding under the Sayfawa dynasty.** The Lake Chad basin polity extends its influence across a wide swath of the central Sahel, controlling trade routes and demanding tribute from neighboring peoples. Kanem's position at the crossroads of east-west and north-south trade routes gives it strategic economic importance. Islam becomes increasingly central to state ideology and administration. | KB | [P] |
| c. 1100-1200 | **Timbuktu founded as a seasonal camp by Tuareg nomads.** Oral tradition ascribes the city's founding to a Tuareg woman named Buktu who tended a well (*tin*) at the site, giving the city its name ("Tin-Buktu" = "well of Buktu"). Initially a seasonal camp, it gradually develops into a permanent settlement at the northernmost point of the Niger Bend, perfectly positioned to serve as a transfer point between river and desert trade. Its later glory as a center of Islamic learning lies ahead. | OTH | [T] |

## 13th Century (1200-1299 CE)

| Date | Event | Polity/Region | Confidence |
|------|-------|---------------|------------|
| c. 1200-1220 | **Sumanguru's Sosso kingdom dominates the western Sahel.** According to oral tradition, Sumanguru Kante conquers the remnants of Ghana and subjugates the Mande clans. He kills eleven of the twelve sons of the Keita clan (the twelfth, Sundiata, is spared because he is disabled and deemed unthreatening). Sumanguru's rule is remembered as oppressive, though this characterization may partly reflect the political interests of the later Mali state that replaced him. | MAL/OTH | [T] |
| c. 1210-1248 | **Reign of Mai Dunama Dibbalemi of Kanem.** The most powerful ruler of the Kanem phase of the empire, Dibbalemi expands the state to its greatest territorial extent, claiming authority from the Fezzan in the north to regions south of Lake Chad. He declares a jihad against neighboring peoples and opens a diplomatic exchange with the Hafsid rulers of Tunis. Critically, he breaks the sacred *mune* talisman — a pre-Islamic royal relic — which traditional accounts blame for the dynastic troubles and civil wars that plagued Kanem in the following century. This act may represent the tension between Islamic reform and indigenous sacral kingship. | KB | [P] |
| c. 1217 | **Traditional birth date of Sundiata Keita.** Born to Sogolon Conde (the "buffalo woman") and Nare Maghan Kon Fatta, a Keita clan ruler, Sundiata was disabled as a child and unable to walk. Different versions of the oral epic describe his disability variously — some say he could not stand until the age of seven; others describe a more permanent condition overcome through spiritual power. The epic's emphasis on Sundiata's disability and triumph over it is one of the great themes of West African oral literature. | MAL | [T] |
| c. 1220s | **Sundiata's exile.** After his father's death and persecution by Sumanguru and by his father's first wife (Sassouma Berete), the young Sundiata goes into exile with his mother and siblings. He wanders through various courts across the Sahel — different oral traditions place him with the kings of Mema, Wagadu, or other polities — building alliances and growing to manhood. The exile period is crucial to the epic's structure: the hero must leave home, gain strength and allies, and return to liberate his people. | MAL | [T] |
| c. 1230s | **Sundiata assembles a coalition of Mande clans against Sosso oppression.** Recalled from exile by emissaries of the oppressed Mande peoples, Sundiata organizes a military alliance. Key allies include Fakoli Koroma (Sumanguru's own nephew who defected after a personal quarrel), Tiramagan Traore, and other Mande leaders. The coalition represents a remarkable political achievement — uniting previously rival clans against a common enemy. | MAL | [T] |
| c. 1235 | **Battle of Kirina: Sundiata defeats Sumanguru Kante, founding the Mali Empire.** The most celebrated battle in West African oral history. Sundiata's coalition confronts Sumanguru's forces at Kirina (location debated — traditionally placed near modern Koulikoro, Mali). According to the epic, Sumanguru's sorcerous power is neutralized by a special arrow tipped with the spur of a white rooster (the blacksmith-king's spiritual weakness). Sumanguru is either killed or vanishes. The victory establishes Mande hegemony across the western Sahel. The historical existence of the battle is [P]; its details are [T]. See [[03-Battles-Campaigns/Major-Conflicts-Index]]. | MAL | [T] — event [P], details [T] |
| c. 1235 | **Kouroukan Fouga (Manden Charter) traditionally proclaimed.** After Kirina, Sundiata convenes an assembly at Kangaba (or Ka-ba) that establishes the social and political principles of the new state. The charter defines clan relationships, occupational castes, women's rights, and governance structures. Whether the Kouroukan Fouga represents a historical event or a later codification of Mande social principles is debated. UNESCO recognized it in 2009 as an intangible cultural heritage. Its core principles include the sanctity of human life, the prohibition of certain forms of slavery, and the defined roles of the nyamakala (occupational castes). | MAL | [D] |
| c. 1235-1255 | **Sundiata's unification campaigns.** Following Kirina, Mali's armies conquer the western Sahel. General Tiramagan Traore takes the Gambia region. Mali absorbs the remnants of the old Ghana/Wagadu state (c. 1240). By Sundiata's death (c. 1255), the empire stretches from the Atlantic coast to the middle Niger, controlling the gold-producing regions of Bambuk and Bure and the major trade routes. Sundiata establishes his capital at Niani on the upper Niger (though the exact location of Niani is debated). | MAL | [P] |
| c. 1240 | **Mali absorbs the remnants of the Ghana/Wagadu polity.** The old Soninke state, already reduced, is incorporated into the new Mali Empire. This represents the final end of the Wagadu state that had dominated the western Sahel for centuries. The Soninke people become subjects of the Mande-speaking Mali elite, though Soninke merchants (Wangara) continue to play a critical role in West African commerce. | GHA/MAL | [P] |
| c. 1255 | **Death of Sundiata Keita.** The circumstances of the founder's death are reported differently across oral traditions — some say he drowned in the Sankarani River; others say he was killed by an arrow at a festival; still others give a peaceful death. The ambiguity around his death is itself significant, reflecting the mythologization of the founder figure. His legacy is the largest empire West Africa had yet seen and the social structures codified in the Kouroukan Fouga. | MAL | [T] |
| c. 1255-1285 | **Period of post-Sundiata succession.** Several of Sundiata's descendants rule Mali, including Mansa Wali (r. c. 1255-1270), who goes on hajj and is considered a competent ruler, and a series of less effective successors. The empire holds together but without the founder's unifying charisma. Internal politics involves complex negotiations between the Keita royal house and the powerful Mande clans who had helped win the empire. | MAL | [P] |
| c. 1285-1300 | **Sakura seizes the Mali throne.** In one of the most extraordinary episodes in West African history, a freed slave (or former royal slave) named Sakura usurps the throne of Mali, ruling effectively and expanding the empire's territory. He goes on hajj to Mecca, demonstrating his legitimacy and piety, but is murdered on the return journey (reportedly in Tajura, in modern Djibouti or Eritrea). Sakura's story demonstrates the remarkable social fluidity of medieval West African societies — a man of servile origin could rule the greatest empire in the region. His life is primarily known through Ibn Khaldun's account. | MAL | [T] |
| c. 1200s | **Hausa city-states developing.** Kano, Katsina, Zazzau (Zaria), Gobir, Daura, Rano, and Biram emerge as significant urban centers in the central Sahel. Each city-state develops its own political structures, often combining Hausa indigenous institutions with gradually increasing Islamic influence. The Kano Chronicle records the reigns of early Hausa kings, including rulers who expanded the city's walls and developed trade with the trans-Saharan network. | HAU | [P] |
| c. 1200s | **Benin Kingdom developing under the Ogiso and early Oba dynasties.** The Edo state in the forest zone of modern Nigeria consolidates power, developing the administrative structures and artistic traditions that will flourish in later centuries. The exact chronology of early Benin rulers is unclear, relying on oral tradition and limited archaeology. | BEN | [T] |
| c. 1200s | **Timbuktu beginning to grow as a permanent settlement.** What started as a Tuareg seasonal camp develops into a trading town as its position at the northernmost bend of the Niger River makes it an ideal transfer point between river commerce and camel caravan routes. The town will be transformed under Mali's patronage in the following century, but its commercial importance is established earlier. | OTH | [P] |

## 14th Century (1300-1399 CE)

| Date | Event | Polity/Region | Confidence |
|------|-------|---------------|------------|
| c. 1300-1312 | **Restoration of the Keita dynasty in Mali after Sakura's death.** The Keita lineage regains the throne. The empire continues to expand and consolidate, benefiting from its control of the gold trade and the trans-Saharan routes. Internal politics involve competition between different branches of the royal family. | MAL | [P] |
| c. 1307-1332 | **Traditional reign of Abu Bakr II (Mansa Muhammad) of Mali.** According to a story reported by al-Umari (based on what Mansa Musa told officials in Cairo), Abu Bakr II sent 200 boats on an expedition across the Atlantic Ocean. When only one returned, reporting that the others had been swept away by a strong current, Abu Bakr himself set out with 2,000 boats and was never seen again. This story is one of the most debated in West African historiography — some scholars take it seriously as evidence of pre-Columbian transatlantic voyages; most treat it as legend or a story Musa told to explain his predecessor's disappearance. | MAL | [T] |
| 1312-1337 | **Reign of Mansa Musa (Musa I) of Mali.** The most famous ruler in West African history and arguably the wealthiest individual of the medieval era. Musa inherits an already-powerful empire and transforms it into an international center of Islamic learning and trade. He patronizes Timbuktu's scholarly community, commissions mosques and educational institutions, and administers a vast territory through a sophisticated provincial system. Arabic sources unanimously describe his extraordinary wealth and piety. | MAL | [E] |
| 1324-1325 | **Mansa Musa's hajj to Mecca.** The defining event of Musa's reign and one of the most famous episodes in medieval African history. His caravan reportedly includes 60,000 people and 80 camels carrying approximately 300 pounds of gold each (figures from Arabic sources; likely exaggerated but indicative of real scale). His lavish spending during a stop in Cairo — distributing gold to officials, scholars, and the poor — causes gold inflation that depresses the metal's value in Egypt for over a decade. The hajj puts Mali on European maps: Musa appears on the 1375 Catalan Atlas, seated on a throne and holding a gold nugget. See [[02-Prosopography/Key-Figures-Index]]. | MAL | [E] |
| c. 1325 | **Al-Sahili (Abu Ishaq Ibrahim al-Sahili) accompanies Mansa Musa back from hajj.** This Andalusian architect and poet returns with Musa to Mali, where he is traditionally credited with introducing fired-brick construction and new architectural styles. He builds (or supervises construction of) the Djinguereber Mosque in Timbuktu and reportedly a palace (the Madugu) at Niani. Whether al-Sahili was truly the innovator of a new architectural tradition or whether he adapted existing Sahelian building techniques is debated, but his arrival symbolizes the cultural exchange that Musa's hajj facilitated. | MAL | [P] |
| c. 1325-1337 | **Timbuktu's growth under Mansa Musa's patronage.** The city, already a significant trading center, is transformed into a major center of Islamic scholarship. Musa builds or expands the Djinguereber Mosque and encourages scholarly activity. Timbuktu's Sankore mosque-university attracts scholars from across the Islamic world. Manuscript culture begins to flourish. The city's intellectual golden age, which will peak in the 15th-16th centuries, has its roots in Musa's patronage. | MAL | [E] |
| 1337-1341 | **Reign of Mansa Maghan I, son of Mansa Musa.** Widely described in Arabic sources as an incompetent ruler who squandered the empire's resources. His short and troubled reign is often cited as the beginning of Mali's slow decline, though the empire remained powerful for another century. | MAL | [P] |
| 1337-1349 | **Al-Umari writes about Mansa Musa's hajj.** The Egyptian scholar Shihab al-Din al-Umari, in his *Masalik al-Absar fi Mamalik al-Amsar*, records interviews with people who had witnessed Musa's passage through Cairo. This text is the single most important source for understanding the scale and impact of the hajj. Al-Umari describes the gold inflation, the protocol of Musa's interactions with the Mamluk sultan, and the administrative structure of the Mali Empire. | MAL | [E] |
| 1341-1360 | **Reign of Mansa Sulayman of Mali.** Musa's brother (or nephew, depending on the source) takes the throne and provides stable rule. He is the ruler whom Ibn Battuta visits in 1352-53. Sulayman is described as less generous than Musa but a competent administrator. He faces a palace conspiracy (possibly led by one of his wives) and political tensions, but the empire remains functional. | MAL | [E] |
| 1352-1353 | **Ibn Battuta visits Mali and is hosted by Mansa Sulayman.** The Moroccan traveler's account in his *Rihla* provides the most detailed eyewitness description of the Mali court. He describes the elaborate royal audience ceremonies, the administration of justice, the role of the djeli (griots) in court proceedings, the Mande custom of women appearing unveiled in public (which shocks him), the practice of sprinkling dust on one's head as a sign of respect to the ruler, and the coexistence of Islamic and indigenous religious practices. Ibn Battuta is both impressed by Mali's order and justice and disapproving of customs he considers un-Islamic. His account is invaluable precisely because of its detail and his mix of admiration and cultural criticism. See [[08-Primary-Sources/Sources-Index]]. | MAL | [E] |
| c. 1360-1390 | **Mali's political stability fraying.** After Mansa Sulayman's death, succession disputes become more frequent and destructive. Multiple claimants vie for the throne, weakening central authority. Provincial governors and tribute-paying polities begin to test Mali's hold. The empire is not yet in collapse, but the political cohesion that characterized the Musa-Sulayman era is eroding. | MAL | [P] |
| 1375 | **Catalan Atlas produced in Majorca by Abraham Cresques.** This mappamundi includes the famous image of Mansa Musa seated on a throne, holding a gold nugget, with the inscription identifying him as the lord of the "Land of the Negroes." This is the first major European cartographic recognition of a sub-Saharan African ruler and demonstrates how the 1324 hajj reshaped European knowledge of Africa. | OTH | [E] |
| c. 1377 | **Ibn Khaldun writes about West African kingdoms in his *Kitab al-'Ibar* and *Muqaddimah*.** The great Tunisian historian provides dynastic histories of Ghana, Mali, and Songhai based on interviews with West African scholars and merchants in Cairo and Tunis. His accounts are especially valuable for filling gaps in the Mali succession and for providing information about the early Songhai state. Ibn Khaldun also met a representative of Mansa Musa II and collected oral information about Mali's political structure. | MAL/GHA/SON | [E] |
| c. 1375-1400 | **Songhai begins asserting independence from Mali.** The small Songhai state at Gao, which had been a vassal or subordinate partner of Mali for over a century, begins to assert its own authority as Mali's central power weakens. The Sonni (Za) dynasty at Gao gradually expands its control over the eastern Niger Bend, setting the stage for the imperial expansion of the next century. | SON | [P] |
| c. 1380s | **Kanem-Bulala wars begin.** The Bulala people, possibly from east of Lake Chad, challenge Sayfawa control of Kanem. This conflict will dominate Kanem-Bornu politics for over a century, eventually driving the Sayfawa dynasty westward to establish a new capital at Bornu (Ngazargamu), west of Lake Chad. The *mune* breaking under Dibbalemi is retrospectively blamed in tradition for the dynasty's vulnerability. | KB | [P] |
| c. 1300s | **Hausa city-states continue to grow.** Kano develops its famous dye-pit industry, producing indigo-dyed cloth that becomes one of the most sought-after trade goods in the Sahel. Katsina emerges as a major entrepot for trans-Saharan trade. Islam is gradually adopted by Hausa ruling elites, though the process is uneven across the different city-states. | HAU | [P] |
| c. 1300s | **Benin Kingdom consolidating.** The Edo state develops the political and artistic institutions that will distinguish it in later centuries. The Oba's court becomes increasingly elaborate, and the bronze-casting tradition (using the lost-wax technique, possibly influenced by contact with Ife) is developing toward its later heights. | BEN | [P] |
| c. 1300s | **Djenne develops as a major center of Islamic learning and mud-brick architecture.** The city in the Inland Niger Delta becomes one of the premier trading and scholarly centers of the western Sahel. Its great mosque (rebuilt in its current form in 1907 but based on earlier structures) epitomizes the banco (sun-dried mud-brick) architectural tradition. Djenne's position at the junction of the Niger and Bani rivers makes it a commercial hub for gold, salt, kola nuts, and enslaved people. | OTH | [P] |
| c. 1300s | **Kola nut trade linking forest zone to Sahel.** The kola nut, a mild stimulant grown in the West African forest zone, becomes an important commodity in the trade between forest and savanna peoples. Valued by Muslims (whose religion prohibits alcohol), kola nuts are traded northward through networks that also carry gold, enslaved people, and other goods. This forest-savanna trade is an indigenous African commercial system independent of the trans-Saharan routes. | OTH | [P] |

## 15th Century (1400-1499 CE)

| Date | Event | Polity/Region | Confidence |
|------|-------|---------------|------------|
| c. 1400-1430 | **Mali continues to weaken.** Peripheral territories break away. The Tuareg seize Timbuktu (c. 1433), a major blow to Mali's prestige and commercial reach. The Mossi peoples raid the Niger Bend. The empire contracts toward its heartland in the upper Niger region, though it does not collapse entirely — Mali will persist in reduced form into the 17th century. | MAL | [P] |
| c. 1433 | **Tuareg nomads seize Timbuktu from Mali.** Under their chief Akil Ag-Amalwal, the Tuareg take control of the great city of learning. Their occupation lasts until 1468, when Sunni Ali of Songhai captures it. During the Tuareg period, Timbuktu's scholars maintain some autonomy, and the city continues to function as a commercial center, but it is no longer under the protection of a major state. | MAL/SON | [P] |
| c. 1440-1473 | **Reign of Ewuare the Great (Ewuare Ogidigan), Oba of Benin.** A transformative ruler who fundamentally reshapes the Benin Kingdom. According to oral tradition, Ewuare returned from exile after his brothers had killed each other in a succession dispute. He then rebuilt Benin City on a grand scale, constructing or expanding the enormous system of earthwork walls and moats (the "Benin Walls," among the largest pre-mechanical earthworks in the world). He reforms the political system, creating new titled offices to counterbalance existing chiefs, and patronizes the bronze-casting guilds. Tragically, he loses two sons to plague (or an epidemic) and imposes a period of kingdom-wide mourning, banning sexual intercourse, drumming, and bathing. | BEN | [P] |
| c. 1440s | **Benin's bronze-casting tradition reaches new heights under Ewuare's patronage.** The lost-wax casting technique, possibly originally acquired from Ife, produces increasingly sophisticated works — commemorative heads of Obas and Queen Mothers, plaques depicting court scenes, and regalia. Benin's bronzes are not merely decorative; they serve as historical records, with plaque sequences documenting royal ceremonies, military campaigns, and diplomatic encounters. | BEN | [P] |
| 1444 | **First Portuguese slave raid on the West African coast.** Lancarote de Freitas leads a raiding expedition to the coast of Mauritania/Senegambia, capturing approximately 235 Africans. This marks the beginning of the Atlantic slave trade, which will transform West African societies over the following centuries. In our period (to 1600), the trade is still relatively small-scale compared to what follows, but its impacts are already being felt in coastal communities. | OTH | [E] |
| c. 1460s | **Kanem-Bulala conflict drives the Sayfawa dynasty to Bornu.** After decades of intermittent warfare with the Bulala, the Sayfawa dynasty relocates its capital westward to Bornu, establishing a new seat at Ngazargamu, west of Lake Chad. The "Bornu phase" of the empire begins. The old Kanem heartland is contested territory, not fully recovered until the reign of Mai Idris Alooma over a century later. | KB | [P] |
| 1463-1499 | **Reign of Muhammad Rumfa, Sultan (Sarki) of Kano.** Rumfa transforms Kano into a model Islamic city-state with the guidance of the North African scholar al-Maghili. His reforms include: building the great Kurmi market (one of the largest in West Africa), establishing the Council of Nine (*Tara ta Kano*) as an advisory body, introducing aspects of Shari'a law, constructing a new palace (*gidan rumfa*), and promoting the celebration of the Id al-Fitr and Id al-Adha festivals. Rumfa's Kano represents the maturation of Islam as a governing ideology in Hausaland. | HAU | [P] |
| c. 1463 | **Al-Maghili visits Hausaland and Songhai.** The North African Maliki jurist Muhammad al-Maghili travels to Kano (where he advises Muhammad Rumfa) and later to Gao (where he advises Askia Muhammad I). His treatises — *The Obligation of Princes* (for Rumfa) and his responses to Askia Muhammad's legal questions — document how African rulers sought to apply Islamic law to their specific political contexts. Al-Maghili is a controversial figure; in his hometown of Tuat (southern Algeria), he incited violence against the local Jewish community. | HAU/SON | [E] |
| 1464-1492 | **Reign of Sunni Ali (Sunni Ali Ber) of Songhai.** A military genius who transforms the small Songhai state at Gao into a vast empire. Through a series of brilliant campaigns, Sunni Ali conquers Timbuktu (1468), Djenne (c. 1473), and extensive territories across the Niger Bend. He is described by the later Timbuktu chronicles (the *Tarikh al-Sudan* and *Tarikh al-Fattash*) as harsh toward Muslim clerics, impious, and possibly a practitioner of indigenous religion alongside nominal Islam. This characterization may partly reflect the bias of the Islamic scholarly class whose autonomy he threatened. Sunni Ali is remembered as a great conqueror but a religiously ambiguous figure. See [[02-Prosopography/Key-Figures-Index]]. | SON | [E] |
| 1468 | **Sunni Ali captures Timbuktu from the Tuareg.** The Songhai ruler expels Akil Ag-Amalwal's Tuareg forces and takes control of the city. He reportedly punishes scholars who had collaborated with the Tuareg occupiers, creating lasting enmity between the Songhai military establishment and Timbuktu's ulama. This tension will persist throughout Songhai's imperial period and shapes the way the Timbuktu chronicles portray Sunni Ali. | SON | [E] |
| c. 1473 | **Sunni Ali captures Djenne after a prolonged siege.** The wealthy trading city of Djenne, which had resisted numerous previous attacks (the *Tarikh al-Sudan* claims it had repelled 99 sieges), finally falls to Songhai. The siege's duration is traditionally given as seven years (likely an exaggeration but indicating a long and difficult campaign). Djenne's incorporation brings its commercial wealth and scholarly traditions into the Songhai Empire. | SON | [P] for the siege; [T] for the seven-year duration |
| c. 1480-1504 | **Reign of Ozolua (Ozolua the Conqueror), Oba of Benin.** A warrior-king who, according to oral tradition, fought over 200 battles, expanding Benin's territory in every direction. Ozolua makes direct contact with the Portuguese, who reach Benin City in the 1480s. He dies in battle during a campaign against the town of Udo, a rival Edo community. | BEN | [T] |
| 1480s | **Portuguese reach the Kingdom of Benin.** Portuguese traders and emissaries arrive at Benin City, providing the first European descriptions of the kingdom. They find a sophisticated, well-governed state with wide, clean streets, a powerful king, and an elaborate court. Initial Portuguese interest focuses on pepper trade, but the relationship gradually shifts toward ivory and enslaved people. Benin's Obas control trade carefully and deal with the Portuguese as equals in this early period. | BEN | [E] |
| 1482 | **Portuguese build Elmina Castle (Sao Jorge da Mina) on the Gold Coast.** The first permanent European structure in sub-Saharan Africa, built with the permission of the local Akan ruler. Positioned to access the gold trade of the Akan forest zone, Elmina represents the beginning of a permanent European commercial presence on the West African coast. | OTH | [E] |
| 1492 | **Death of Sunni Ali.** The great conqueror dies under unclear circumstances — possibly drowning while crossing a river, or illness. His son, Sunni Baru, succeeds him but faces immediate opposition from the Islamic faction within the empire. | SON | [E] |
| 1493 | **Askia Muhammad I (Muhammad Ture) overthrows Sunni Baru.** A Soninke-origin general and devout Muslim, Muhammad Ture seizes the throne after defeating Sunni Ali's son at the Battle of Anfao. He refounds Songhai as an explicitly Islamic empire, adopting the title "Askia" and making a clean break with the Sonni dynasty. This is both a military coup and an ideological revolution — the Islamic scholars of Timbuktu, who had clashed with Sunni Ali, enthusiastically support the new regime. See [[02-Prosopography/Key-Figures-Index]]. | SON | [E] |
| 1493-1528 | **Reign of Askia Muhammad I of Songhai.** The longest and most transformative reign in Songhai history. Askia Muhammad reforms the empire's administration, dividing it into provinces with appointed governors, establishing standardized taxation, weights, and measures, and creating a professional bureaucracy. He patronizes Timbuktu's scholars, invites learned men to his court, and seeks to govern according to Islamic law. He consults al-Maghili on legal matters and receives the scholar's influential treatise on Islamic governance. | SON | [E] |
| 1496-1497 | **Askia Muhammad's hajj to Mecca.** Less spectacular than Mansa Musa's pilgrimage 170 years earlier but politically significant. Muhammad distributes substantial alms and reportedly receives the title "Caliph of the Sudan" from the Abbasid caliph-in-exile in Cairo (though this claim is disputed by some scholars). The hajj legitimizes his rule in the eyes of the Islamic scholarly establishment. He establishes diplomatic contacts with the Mamluk and Ottoman empires. | SON | [E] |

## 16th Century (1500-1599 CE)

| Date | Event | Polity/Region | Confidence |
|------|-------|---------------|------------|
| c. 1500 | **Timbuktu at its intellectual peak.** The city's three great mosque-universities — Sankore, Djinguereber, and Sidi Yahia — support hundreds of scholars engaged in Islamic law, theology, rhetoric, logic, grammar, history, and astronomy. Thousands of manuscripts circulate in the city's vibrant book trade. Private libraries of wealthy scholars contain thousands of volumes. The Sankore tradition emphasizes independent scholarly authority, sometimes in tension with state power. Timbuktu in this period is one of the major intellectual centers of the Islamic world. | SON | [E] |
| c. 1504-1550 | **Reign of Esigie, Oba of Benin.** A scholarly ruler who, according to tradition, learned to speak and read Portuguese — one of the earliest documented instances of an African ruler acquiring a European language. He patronizes the bronze-casting guilds, producing some of the finest Benin bronzes, and deals diplomatically with European powers while maintaining Benin's sovereignty. His mother Idia serves as a powerful political figure: she reportedly led military forces in support of his claim to the throne against his brother Arhuaran. The famous ivory mask of Queen Mother Idia, one of the most iconic objects in African art, dates from Esigie's reign. | BEN | [P] |
| c. 1500-1520 | **Queen Mother Idia's political influence at peak in Benin.** As the Iyoba (Queen Mother), Idia wields extraordinary political and reportedly spiritual power. She is credited with using medicinal and magical knowledge to support her son Esigie's military campaigns, including the war against the Atta of Igala. The office of Iyoba, formalized under Esigie, becomes a permanent and powerful position in the Benin political hierarchy — a reflection of the significant political role women could play in West African forest-zone kingdoms. | BEN | [P] |
| c. 1500-1520 | **Songhai Empire at its greatest territorial extent under Askia Muhammad I.** The empire stretches from the Senegal River in the west to the Hausa borderlands in the east, and from the Saharan salt mines in the north to the fringes of the forest zone in the south. It is the largest state West Africa has ever seen. Major cities under Songhai control include Gao (the capital), Timbuktu, Djenne, and numerous towns along the Niger. | SON | [E] |
| 1510s | **Portuguese establish a trading relationship with Benin.** Trade focuses on pepper, ivory, cloth, and enslaved people, though the Obas of Benin carefully regulate the terms. The Portuguese also send missionaries, but Christianity gains little traction. The trading post (factory) at Ughoton, Benin's port city, becomes a significant point of contact. European goods — including brass manillas that are melted down and recast as bronzes — begin to flow into Benin. | BEN | [E] |
| 1526 | **Leo Africanus (al-Hasan ibn Muhammad al-Wazzan) writes the *Descrittione dell'Africa*.** Written in Rome years after his West African travels and published in 1550, this text provides a vivid (if sometimes embellished) eyewitness account of Timbuktu, Gao, and other Sahelian cities. He describes Timbuktu's wealth: "The rich king of Tombuto hath many plates and scepters of gold... Here are many doctors, judges, priests, and other learned men that are bountifully maintained at the king's cost and charges. And hither are brought diverse manuscripts or written books out of Barbary, which are sold for more money than any other merchandise." Leo's account, written for a Christian audience by a Muslim convert, is a complex document requiring careful interpretation. | SON | [E] |
| 1528 | **Askia Muhammad I deposed by his own sons.** Blind, elderly, and increasingly unable to govern, the great reformer is removed from power by his son Askia Musa, beginning a period of dynastic instability. Muhammad lives on in confinement until his death in 1538, eventually buried in a tomb at Gao that still stands. The post-Muhammad period sees a rapid succession of short-lived rulers as different sons and nephews fight for power. | SON | [E] |
| 1528-1549 | **Period of Songhai dynastic instability.** At least five askias rule in rapid succession following Muhammad I's deposition. Despite this political turmoil, the empire's administrative structures — the provincial system, the army, the judiciary — continue to function, demonstrating the institutional strength that Askia Muhammad had built. Timbuktu's scholars maintain their independence and productivity regardless of who holds the throne. | SON | [E] |
| c. 1530s | **Mali Empire now reduced to its heartland.** The once-vast empire has contracted to the Mande heartland in the upper Niger region. Songhai has absorbed its eastern and northern provinces, including Timbuktu. Mali's mansa still rules, but the empire is a shadow of its former self. It will continue to exist in diminished form into the 17th century, an unusually long twilight for a major African state. | MAL | [P] |
| 1549-1582 | **Reign of Askia Dawud of Songhai.** The last great Songhai ruler restores stability after decades of succession crises. Dawud is an effective administrator, patron of learning, and competent military commander. He maintains correspondence with the Moroccan Sa'adi dynasty, and under his rule the Songhai Empire reaches its final peak of power and prosperity. He is said to have memorized the Quran and to have maintained a private library. His death in 1582 begins the final phase of Songhai's decline. | SON | [E] |
| 1556 | **Birth of Ahmad Baba al-Timbukti.** The man who will become the greatest scholar of Timbuktu — author of over 40 works on Islamic jurisprudence, biography, grammar, and other subjects — is born into a family of distinguished scholars. His life will span the destruction of the Songhai intellectual world by the Moroccan invasion. | SON | [E] |
| c. 1560s-1590s | **Queen Amina of Zazzau (Zaria) leads military campaigns across Hausaland.** According to oral tradition, Amina was a warrior princess who succeeded her mother as ruler of Zazzau and led military campaigns for 34 years. She is credited with conquering Kano and Katsina, extending Zazzau's territory, and building fortification walls (*ganuwar Amina*) around the cities she conquered. Amina is one of the most celebrated female rulers in African history. Her dates are debated — some traditions place her earlier (15th century); the most common dating is the later 16th century. Whether the fortification walls attributed to her were all built by her or represent an older building tradition is uncertain. | HAU | [T] |
| c. 1564-1596 | **Reign of Mai Idris Alooma of Bornu.** The greatest ruler of the Bornu phase of the Kanem-Bornu Empire. Alooma is a military innovator — he is among the first sub-Saharan African rulers to employ firearms (muskets and probably some light cannon, acquired from the Ottoman Empire via the trans-Saharan trade). He reforms Bornu's military, legal, and administrative systems, builds brick mosques to replace reed structures, goes on hajj, and recovers some of the old Kanem territories from the Bulala. Uniquely among West African rulers of this period, Alooma's campaigns are documented in detail by his imam, Ahmad ibn Fartua, whose chronicle provides one of the richest African-authored military accounts of the pre-modern era. | KB | [E] |
| c. 1570s-1580s | **Ahmad ibn Fartua writes his account of Mai Idris Alooma's wars.** This chronicle, one of the few surviving indigenous West African prose narratives from the pre-colonial period, describes Alooma's campaigns in vivid detail: battles with the Bulala, the Tubu, the So peoples, and others. It records the use of firearms, the construction of fortified camps, the taking of hostages, and the imposition of Islamic law on conquered peoples. The chronicle is both a propaganda document and a genuine military history of rare quality. | KB | [E] |
| 1582-1591 | **Songhai's final decade.** After Askia Dawud's death, succession disputes resume. Askia Muhammad II (Bani), Askia Ishaq II, and others hold the throne briefly. Meanwhile, the Sa'adi dynasty of Morocco, under Sultan Ahmad al-Mansur, covets Songhai's control of the trans-Saharan gold trade and the Taghaza salt mines. Diplomatic exchanges turn hostile when Songhai refuses Moroccan demands for tribute. | SON | [E] |
| 1585 | **Moroccan forces seize the Taghaza salt mines.** Sultan Ahmad al-Mansur sends troops to occupy the vital salt-producing site in the Sahara, a key revenue source for Songhai. This is a prelude to the full-scale invasion that follows six years later. Askia Ishaq II attempts to retaliate but fails to dislodge the Moroccans. | SON | [E] |
| 1590-1591 | **Moroccan invasion force crosses the Sahara.** Sultan Ahmad al-Mansur dispatches an expeditionary force of approximately 4,000 soldiers under the command of Judar Pasha, a Spanish-born eunuch. The force includes musketeers, European renegade soldiers, and a camel supply train. The crossing of the Sahara — one of the most remarkable military feats of the 16th century — takes approximately five months and costs significant casualties from heat and thirst before a battle is even fought. | SON | [E] |
| March 12, 1591 | **Battle of Tondibi: Moroccan firearms destroy the Songhai Empire.** Judar Pasha's force, armed with muskets and light artillery, confronts Askia Ishaq II's much larger Songhai army (estimated at 30,000-40,000, though numbers are debated) at Tondibi, north of Gao. The Songhai attempt a cattle stampede to disrupt the Moroccan lines, but the gunfire panics the animals back into the Songhai ranks. Moroccan firepower routs the Songhai cavalry. The defeat is total. Gao falls without further resistance. Timbuktu surrenders. The last great Sahelian empire is shattered in a single afternoon. This battle is one of the most consequential in African history — it ends the era of the great Sahel empires and fragments political authority in the Niger Bend for centuries. See [[03-Battles-Campaigns/Major-Conflicts-Index]]. | SON | [E] |
| 1591-1600+ | **Songhai resistance continues after Tondibi.** Despite the catastrophic defeat, Songhai loyalists wage guerrilla resistance against the Moroccan occupiers. Askia Nuh leads resistance campaigns in the countryside. The Moroccans control the cities (Gao, Timbuktu, Djenne) but never pacify the rural areas. Over time, the Moroccan garrison (the Arma) intermarries with the local population and becomes a distinct ruling group, increasingly independent of Morocco. The administrative and intellectual structures of the Songhai state, however, are irreparably damaged. | SON | [E] |
| 1593 | **Ahmad Baba al-Timbukti arrested and exiled to Marrakesh by Moroccan occupiers.** The greatest scholar of Timbuktu, Ahmad Baba is imprisoned and then deported to Morocco, where he is held for approximately 14 years. His arrest is part of the Moroccans' systematic suppression of Timbuktu's scholarly class, which had resisted the occupation. Ahmad Baba's exile symbolizes the destruction of the Songhai intellectual world. He eventually returns to Timbuktu (c. 1607) and resumes teaching, but the city's golden age as a center of learning is over. His library, containing thousands of manuscripts, is reportedly dispersed or destroyed during the occupation. | SON | [E] |
| 1593-1599 | **Moroccan occupiers consolidate control over the Niger Bend.** Judar Pasha is replaced by Mahmud Zarqun as pasha of Timbuktu. The Moroccans extract wealth from the conquered territories but struggle with logistical challenges — the Sahara crossing makes reinforcement and supply difficult. Moroccan governors increasingly operate independently of Marrakesh. The trans-Saharan trade routes, disrupted by the invasion, never fully recover their former volume. | SON/OTH | [E] |
| c. 1590s | **Benin Kingdom remains powerful and independent.** While the Sahel empires collapse, Benin in the forest zone continues to thrive under a succession of capable Obas. Portuguese and now other European traders visit Benin City, which they describe as a large, well-organized urban center with wide streets, an elaborate palace complex, and sophisticated governance. The bronze-casting tradition continues to produce masterworks. Benin's relative isolation from the upheavals of the Sahel and its strong military position in the forest zone protect it from the fate of Songhai. | BEN | [P] |
| c. 1590s | **Hausa city-states continue to develop independently.** Following Queen Amina's campaigns, the Hausa cities — Kano, Katsina, Zazzau, Gobir, and others — continue to function as major centers of commerce, craft production, and Islamic learning. Kano's cloth-dyeing industry and Katsina's position as a trans-Saharan trade entrepot give them economic importance. The political fragmentation of the Hausa states will continue until the Fulani jihad of 1804 (outside this project's scope). | HAU | [P] |
| c. 1500-1600 | **Mali Empire persists in diminished form.** Though reduced to its Mande heartland, the Mali mansa still holds court and commands some authority in the upper Niger region. Portuguese and other European sources confirm the continued existence of a "Melli" kingdom in this period, though it is now a minor power. The Keita dynasty endures, but its domain is a fraction of Mansa Musa's vast empire. The Sundiata epic continues to be performed by djeli across the Mande world, keeping alive the memory of Mali's glory even as its political power fades. | MAL | [P] |

## Scholarly Debates

This section highlights the major scholarly disputes relevant to West African chronology. These debates are not mere academic quibbles; they reflect genuine uncertainty in the sources and have significant implications for how we understand West African history.

### 1. The Almoravid "Conquest" of Ghana (c. 1076)

**The question:** Did the Almoravids militarily conquer the Ghana Empire, or was the decline more gradual and multifaceted?

**Traditional view:** The Almoravids, after conquering Morocco and Mauritania, attacked and captured Ghana's capital (Koumbi Saleh) in 1076, forcing conversion to Islam and fatally weakening the state. This narrative relies primarily on al-Zuhri and later Arabic sources.

**Revisionist view:** Scholars including David Conrad, Humphrey Fisher, and Pekka Masonen argue that there is no contemporary evidence for a direct military conquest. Al-Bakri, writing in 1068 (before the supposed conquest), describes a Ghana that already has significant Muslim influence. The Almoravid movement itself was fragmenting by this time. The decline of Ghana may have been caused by a combination of environmental pressures (desertification, overgrazing), trade route shifts, and the rise of competing polities (Sosso, Mande groups), rather than a single military blow.

**Current consensus:** [Debated] — most recent scholarship leans toward the revisionist view but the question is not settled. See Gomez, *African Dominion* (2018), for the most current synthesis.

### 2. Dating the Battle of Kirina

**The question:** When exactly did Sundiata defeat Sumanguru?

**Common dating:** c. 1235, based on genealogical calculations from the Sundiata epic and cross-referencing with Arabic sources.

**Alternative datings:** Range from c. 1230 to c. 1240. The oral tradition preserves the sequence of events but not precise dates. The identification of Sundiata with specific Arabic references (e.g., in Ibn Khaldun) requires interpretive assumptions.

**Location:** The site of Kirina itself is debated. Tradition places it near modern Koulikoro in Mali, but the specific battlefield has never been identified archaeologically.

**Current consensus:** [P] for c. 1235; the event itself is generally accepted as historical, though its details are [T].

### 3. The Kouroukan Fouga

**The question:** Was the Manden Charter a historical proclamation by Sundiata, or a later codification of Mande social norms retroactively attributed to the founder?

**Arguments for historicity:** The charter encodes real Mande social structures (clan relationships, nyamakala castes, governance principles) that demonstrably predate the colonial period. UNESCO's recognition (2009) as intangible cultural heritage is based on its cultural significance, regardless of precise historical origin.

**Arguments for later codification:** No contemporary evidence for a single proclamation. The charter as recorded in the 20th century may represent accumulated social practices attributed to Sundiata for legitimation purposes. Different regional versions of the Sundiata epic vary on what was proclaimed.

**Current consensus:** [D] — the social principles are real and old; whether they were formally proclaimed at a specific historical moment is uncertain.

### 4. Niani as Mali's Capital

**The question:** Was the village of Niani on the upper Niger River actually the capital of the Mali Empire?

**Traditional view:** Based on oral tradition and some Arabic references, Niani (in modern Guinea) was the capital. Excavations by Wladyslaw Filipowiak in the 1960s-70s found some remains.

**Revisionist view:** Some scholars (notably Eric Huysecom) argue that the archaeological evidence at Niani does not support a major capital — the site is too small and the finds too modest. Alternative candidates include Dakajalan or other sites in the Mande heartland.

**Current consensus:** [D] — Niani remains the conventional identification, but the evidence is genuinely uncertain.

### 5. Abu Bakr II's Atlantic Expedition

**The question:** Did Mansa Abu Bakr II really send (or lead) an expedition across the Atlantic Ocean?

**The source:** The story comes from al-Umari, based on what Mansa Musa reportedly told officials in Cairo during his 1324 hajj. Musa may have been using the story to explain his predecessor's disappearance.

**Arguments for historicity:** West African maritime technology was capable of Atlantic crossing; ocean currents from the West African coast can carry vessels to the Americas.

**Arguments against:** No independent confirmation from any source. The story conveniently justifies Musa's succession. No archaeological evidence of West African contact with the Americas has been confirmed.

**Current consensus:** [T] — fascinating but unconfirmed. Most historians treat it cautiously.

### 6. Queen Amina's Dates and Campaigns

**The question:** When did Queen Amina of Zazzau reign, and to what extent are her military campaigns historical?

**Common dating:** c. 1560s-1590s, placing her contemporary with Idris Alooma.

**Alternative dating:** Some traditions place her in the 15th century, contemporary with Muhammad Rumfa.

**The walls:** Fortification walls across Hausaland are attributed to Amina (*ganuwar Amina*), but many of these walls predate any plausible date for her reign, suggesting the attribution may be honorific rather than literal.

**Current consensus:** [T] — Amina was almost certainly a historical figure, but the details and dates of her campaigns are drawn from oral tradition and are not independently confirmed.

### 7. Sunni Ali's Religion

**The question:** Was Sunni Ali a Muslim, a practitioner of indigenous Songhai religion, or both?

**The Timbuktu chronicles' view:** The *Tarikh al-Sudan* and *Tarikh al-Fattash* portray Sunni Ali as impious, cruel to Muslim scholars, and a practitioner of sorcery and indigenous religion. They contrast him unfavorably with his successor Askia Muhammad.

**Revisionist view:** The chronicles were written by Timbuktu scholars who had reason to vilify Sunni Ali (he had punished scholars who collaborated with the Tuareg) and to glorify Askia Muhammad (who patronized them). Sunni Ali was probably a pragmatic ruler who balanced Islamic and indigenous constituencies, as many West African rulers did.

**Current consensus:** [D] — the truth likely lies between the chronicles' hostile portrait and the revisionist rehabilitation. Sunni Ali probably practiced a form of religious syncretism common among Sahelian rulers.

### 8. Army Sizes at Tondibi (1591)

**The question:** How large were the armies at the Battle of Tondibi?

**Moroccan force:** Generally agreed at approximately 4,000 (including musketeers, cavalry, and support), based on Moroccan sources. Some estimates run slightly higher.

**Songhai force:** Estimates range from 12,500 to 40,000+. The larger figures come from the Timbuktu chronicles, which may have exaggerated to emphasize the scale of the disaster. The smaller estimates are based on what the Songhai logistical system could plausibly have supported.

**Current consensus:** The Moroccan force was approximately 4,000 [P]; the Songhai force was significantly larger [E] but the precise figure is [D].
