# TL-03: Southern Africa Regional Timeline
## Zimbabwe Plateau, Kongo Kingdom, and the Southern Interior (~300-1600 CE)

*This timeline covers the Zimbabwe Plateau civilizations (Mapungubwe, Great Zimbabwe, Mutapa, Rozvi), the Kingdom of Kongo, and related polities of southern and central-southern Africa. This region relies heavily on archaeology for dating, as written records are scarce before Portuguese contact (post-1480s). Oral tradition supplements the archaeological record but provides sequence rather than absolute dates.*

## Sources for Southern African Chronology

- **Archaeology:** The primary evidence. Radiocarbon dating, ceramic sequences (especially Leopard's Kopje, Gumanye, and Zimbabwe-period pottery), and architectural phases provide the chronological scaffold. Key sites: Mapungubwe, Great Zimbabwe, Khami, Ingombe Ilede.
- **Oral tradition:** Shona oral traditions preserve dynastic sequences for Mutapa and Rozvi but without absolute dates. Kongo traditions recorded by European missionaries.
- **Portuguese sources:** From the 1490s onward, Portuguese traders and missionaries provide the first written descriptions of the interior. Biased toward commercial interests but contain unique observations.
- **Swahili/Arabic sources:** Indirect references to the gold trade and "Sofala" in Arabic geographic writings. Limited detail on interior polities.
- **Material culture:** Gold objects, imported trade goods (Chinese porcelain, Indian beads, glass), and iron artifacts help date sites and establish trade connections.

**Note on silence:** The relative brevity of this timeline compared to West Africa or the Horn of Africa reflects source limitations, not historical simplicity. The builders of Great Zimbabwe created one of Africa's most impressive architectural achievements; their political and social sophistication is beyond question. What we lack are names, dates, and narrative detail for most of this history.

## Early Period (~300-899 CE)

| Date | Event | Polity/Context | Confidence |
|------|-------|----------------|------------|
| c. 300-500 | **Early farming communities expand** across the Limpopo-Zambezi region. Bantu-speaking peoples with iron-smelting technology, cattle-herding, and grain agriculture. Foundation populations for later states. | Southern African interior | [E] |
| c. 300-600 | **Earliest iron-smelting evidence** on the Zimbabwe Plateau. Communities develop mixed farming economies (cattle, grain, iron). Settlements are small and dispersed. | Zimbabwe Plateau | [E] |
| c. 500-700 | **Zhizo culture develops** on the Zimbabwe Plateau. Cattle-focused communities begin to show signs of growing social complexity and regional trade. | Zimbabwe Plateau | [P] |
| c. 600-800 | **Indian Ocean trade begins to reach the interior.** Glass beads and other imported goods appear at inland sites, indicating that coastal Swahili traders (or intermediaries) are exchanging goods for gold, ivory, and iron from the interior. | Coastal-interior trade | [P] |
| c. 700-900 | **Leopard's Kopje culture emerges** in the Limpopo-Shashe confluence area. Predecessor to Mapungubwe. Increasing social differentiation visible in settlement patterns and burial goods. Cattle wealth becomes a marker of status. | Limpopo valley | [E] |
| c. 800s | **Gold-working begins** in the Zimbabwe Plateau region. Alluvial gold collected from rivers; some mining of reef deposits. Gold will become the primary export linking the interior to the Indian Ocean trade network. | Zimbabwe Plateau | [P] |

## Mapungubwe Period (~900-1300 CE)

| Date | Event | Polity/Context | Confidence |
|------|-------|----------------|------------|
| c. 900-1000 | **K2 settlement develops** at the Limpopo-Shashe confluence. Predecessor to Mapungubwe. Growing evidence of social hierarchy and long-distance trade (glass beads from the Indian Ocean coast). | K2 / Limpopo valley | [E] |
| c. 1000 | **Population at K2 grows.** Cattle enclosures become larger and more organized. Elites begin to distinguish themselves through imported trade goods and gold objects. | K2 | [P] |
| c. 1075 | **Mapungubwe established.** Population shifts from K2 to the nearby flat-topped sandstone hill of Mapungubwe. Elites occupy the hilltop — separated spatially from commoners in the valley below. This spatial separation of rulers and ruled is the defining feature of the "Zimbabwe culture." | Mapungubwe | [E] |
| c. 1075-1220 | **Mapungubwe at its height.** First class-based society in southern Africa. The hilltop is reserved for rulers and elites; commoners live below. Gold-working, long-distance trade with the Swahili Coast (via Sofala), and cattle wealth are the economic foundations. | Mapungubwe | [E] |
| c. 1100 | **Gold rhinoceros and other prestige objects** buried with Mapungubwe elites. The gold rhinoceros, gold scepter, and thousands of imported glass beads demonstrate wealth and Indian Ocean trade connections. | Mapungubwe | [E] |
| c. 1100 | **Great Zimbabwe construction begins.** Stone-walling starts at the site that will become the largest and most famous Zimbabwe-tradition settlement. Initially modest; major building phases come later. | Great Zimbabwe | [D] — date range debated |
| c. 1170-1220 | **Mapungubwe begins to decline.** Possibly due to climate change (the Medieval Warm Period gives way to cooler conditions, reducing agricultural productivity in the Limpopo valley). Population shifts northward toward the Zimbabwe Plateau, where rainfall is more reliable. | Mapungubwe | [P] |
| c. 1220 | **Mapungubwe abandoned** as a major center. Power and population shift to the Great Zimbabwe region. The "Zimbabwe culture" model (hilltop elite, stone-walled enclosures, cattle-based economy, gold trade) transfers northward. | Mapungubwe → Great Zimbabwe | [P] |

---

## Great Zimbabwe Period (~1220-1450 CE)

| Date | Event | Polity/Context | Confidence |
|------|-------|----------------|------------|
| c. 1220-1280 | **Great Zimbabwe grows rapidly.** Major stone-walling construction begins. The Hill Complex (likely the royal residence and ritual center) is built on the granite hill overlooking the valley. | Great Zimbabwe | [D] — phasing debated |
| c. 1250-1300 | **Great Enclosure construction begins.** The iconic outer wall — 250 meters long, up to 11 meters high, built of precisely fitted granite blocks without mortar — takes shape in the valley below the Hill Complex. The conical tower is built within. | Great Zimbabwe | [D] |
| c. 1280-1350 | **Great Zimbabwe at growing peak.** Controls the gold trade between the Zimbabwe Plateau goldfields and the Swahili Coast port of Sofala (and thence to Kilwa). Cattle herds provide the primary economic base; gold trade provides prestige goods and wealth. | Great Zimbabwe | [P] |
| c. 1300s | **Population reaches its peak** — possibly 10,000-20,000 people in and around the Great Zimbabwe complex. One of the largest urban centers in sub-Saharan Africa at the time. The figure is based on settlement area and is [Speculative]. | Great Zimbabwe | [S] |
| c. 1300s | **Imported goods at Great Zimbabwe:** Chinese celadon and blue-and-white porcelain (Song-Yuan-Ming dynasties), Indian glass beads, Persian Gulf ceramics. Evidence of connections to a trade network spanning half the globe. | Great Zimbabwe | [E] |
| c. 1300s | **Zimbabwe Bird soapstone carvings** created. Eight carved soapstone birds found at the Hill Complex — likely symbols of royal authority or spiritual power. Now the national emblem of Zimbabwe. | Great Zimbabwe | [E] |
| c. 1300-1400 | **Hundreds of smaller "zimbabwe" sites** built across the plateau. The dry-stone walling tradition spreads to elite settlements throughout the region, suggesting a network of tributary or allied centers under Great Zimbabwe's hegemony. | Zimbabwe Plateau | [E] |
| c. 1300-1400 | **Mwari cult possibly active** at Great Zimbabwe. The high god Mwari, associated with rain, fertility, and the Matopos hills, may have been worshipped at the site. The Hill Complex may have had religious as well as political functions. | Great Zimbabwe | [S] |
| c. 1350-1400 | **Great Zimbabwe's position in Indian Ocean trade.** The gold trade route: Plateau goldfields → Great Zimbabwe (political control) → Sofala (coastal outlet) → Kilwa (Indian Ocean hub) → Arabia, India, and beyond. Great Zimbabwe sits at the center of this chain. | Zimbabwe Plateau trade | [P] |
| c. 1400-1420 | **Signs of stress at Great Zimbabwe.** Possible environmental degradation (deforestation, overgrazing, soil exhaustion around the large settlement). Political tensions. Trade route shifts. | Great Zimbabwe | [S] |
| c. 1420-1450 | **Political fragmentation at Great Zimbabwe.** Rival factions and succession disputes. Breakaway movements begin, including Nyatsimba Mutota's migration northward. | Great Zimbabwe | [T] |
| c. 1430 | **Nyatsimba Mutota breaks away** from Great Zimbabwe and moves north, conquering territory between the Zambezi and Limpopo rivers. Founds what will become the Mutapa Empire. The motivation may have been to control salt sources, trade routes, or simply new territory. | Mutapa formation | [T] |
| c. 1440-1450 | **Great Zimbabwe effectively abandoned** as a major political center. Population disperses. Stone buildings remain standing but the site loses its role as the paramount center. The reasons are debated: environmental, political, economic, or some combination. | Great Zimbabwe | [D] |

## Mutapa and Successor States (~1430-1600 CE)

| Date | Event | Polity/Context | Confidence |
|------|-------|----------------|------------|
| c. 1430-1480 | **Nyatsimba Mutota and his successor Matope expand** the Mutapa Empire. Control territory from the Zambezi to the Limpopo, including gold-producing regions. The title "Mwene Mutapa" (Lord of the Conquered Lands) gives the state its name. Europeans later corrupt this to "Monomotapa." | Mutapa Empire | [T] |
| c. 1450-1500 | **Torwa state established at Khami** near modern Bulawayo. A successor polity to Great Zimbabwe in the southwestern plateau. Different architectural style (decorated walls with check patterns) but continuous with the Zimbabwe tradition. | Torwa/Khami | [P] |
| c. 1480s | **Portuguese traders begin penetrating the interior** from the Sofala coast, seeking gold. They encounter the Mutapa Empire and establish trading relationships. | Mutapa / Portuguese | [E] |
| c. 1490 | **Changamire Dombo rebels against Mutapa.** A powerful vassal named Changamire defeats both the Mutapa forces and Portuguese mercenaries. Establishes the Rozvi Empire in the southwestern plateau. | Rozvi/Changamire | [P] |
| c. 1490-1494 | **Changamire Dombo consolidates power.** The Rozvi state controls the former Torwa territories and eventually much of the Zimbabwe Plateau. Military innovation and effective political organization. | Rozvi Empire | [P] |
| c. 1500s | **Portuguese presence in Mutapa territory grows.** Trading stations (*feiras*) established in the interior. Portuguese seek to control the gold trade directly. Increasing interference in Mutapa politics. | Mutapa / Portuguese | [E] |
| 1505 | **Portuguese establish factory at Sofala.** The coastal outlet for Zimbabwe Plateau gold is now under Portuguese control. Interior trade must pass through Portuguese intermediaries. | Sofala / Portuguese | [E] |
| c. 1510-1560 | **Portuguese gradually establish trading posts** deeper in the Zambezi valley and on the plateau. Sena and Tete become Portuguese bases. Relations with Mutapa alternate between cooperation and conflict. | Mutapa / Portuguese | [E] |
| c. 1560s | **Jesuit missionaries arrive** in Mutapa territory. Limited success in conversion. Their accounts provide some of the earliest European descriptions of the interior. | Mutapa | [E] |
| 1569 | **Portuguese military expedition** led by Francisco Barreto attempts to conquer the Mutapa gold mines. Disastrous failure — disease and Mutapa resistance destroy the Portuguese force. | Mutapa / Portuguese | [E] |
| c. 1570s-1590s | **Mutapa weakened** by Portuguese interference, internal succession conflicts, and Rozvi/Changamire pressure. The empire fragments. | Mutapa | [P] |

## Kongo Kingdom (~1390-1600 CE)

| Date | Event | Polity/Context | Confidence |
|------|-------|----------------|------------|
| c. 1390 | **Kongo Kingdom founded** (traditional dating). Lukeni lua Nimi unites several Kikongo-speaking peoples south of the Congo River. Capital established at Mbanza Kongo. | Kongo | [T] |
| c. 1400s | **Kongo develops** as a centralized monarchy. The ManiKongo rules through appointed provincial governors. Tribute system, redistribution economy, ironworking and pottery production. Capital at Mbanza Kongo on a fertile plateau. | Kongo | [P] |
| c. 1400s | **Kongo political system** features a complex hierarchy: the ManiKongo at the top, with subordinate provincial lords (Mani Mpemba, Mani Soyo, Mani Mbata, etc.). Succession is not strictly hereditary — election by a council of electors from among eligible candidates. | Kongo | [P] |
| 1483 | **Portuguese arrive at the Kongo Kingdom.** Diogo Cão's expedition reaches the mouth of the Congo River and makes contact with the ManiKongo. First meeting between Kongo and Europeans. | Kongo / Portuguese | [E] |
| 1485 | **Kongo-Portuguese diplomacy begins.** ManiKongo Nzinga a Nkuwu sends emissaries to Portugal. Portuguese missionaries, artisans, and traders arrive in Kongo. A relationship of nominal equals — not colonizer and colonized. | Kongo / Portuguese | [E] |
| 1491 | **Nzinga a Nkuwu baptized as João I.** The ManiKongo converts to Christianity along with members of the court. Churches built at Mbanza Kongo. Some accounts say he later returned to traditional practices. | Kongo | [E] |
| c. 1504 | **Death of Nzinga a Nkuwu.** Succession crisis between his sons — Afonso (Mvemba a Nzinga), who embraces Christianity, and Mpanzu a Kitima, who supports traditional religion. | Kongo | [E] |
| 1506-1509 | **Kongo succession crisis.** Afonso I (Mvemba a Nzinga) defeats his brother Mpanzu a Kitima in battle. Afonso attributes his victory to miraculous intervention by St. James the Great (Santiago), whose image was allegedly seen in the sky. Christianity cemented as Kongo's court religion. | Kongo | [E] |
| 1509-1542 | **Reign of Afonso I (Mvemba a Nzinga) of Kongo.** One of the most remarkable rulers in African history. Embraces Christianity fervently; learns to read Portuguese; establishes schools; sends young Kongolese to study in Portugal and Rome. Seeks to modernize Kongo through European alliance while maintaining sovereignty. | Kongo | [E] |
| c. 1510s | **Slave trade begins to escalate.** Portuguese traders, initially interested in copper, ivory, and textiles, increasingly focus on acquiring slaves from and through Kongo. The trade begins to destabilize Kongo's social fabric. | Kongo / Portuguese | [E] |
| 1512 | **Regimento** (instructions) issued by the Portuguese king to his ambassador in Kongo. Outlines the terms of the Portuguese-Kongo relationship. Reveals Portuguese assumptions of cultural superiority alongside pragmatic recognition of Kongo's independence. | Kongo / Portuguese | [E] |
| c. 1514 | **Henrique, son of Afonso I, consecrated as bishop.** The first sub-Saharan African Catholic bishop. Studied in Portugal and Rome. Died young (c. 1531); no African replacement named for centuries. | Kongo | [E] |
| 1526 | **Afonso I writes to the King of Portugal** protesting the slave trade. His letters are extraordinary documents: eloquent, angry, and politically sophisticated. He describes how Portuguese slave traders are depopulating his kingdom, taking even members of noble families. He asks that Portugal send only "priests and teachers" and not "traders and goods." | Kongo | [E] |
| 1526-1540 | **Afonso I's letters continue.** He becomes increasingly desperate as the slave trade devastates Kongo. The Portuguese king responds with platitudes. Afonso's vision of partnership between equals is being betrayed by economic exploitation. | Kongo | [E] |
| c. 1535 | **Attempted assassination of Afonso I** during Easter Mass. Portuguese plotters (or their allies) attack the king in church. He survives. Demonstrates the growing tensions. | Kongo | [E] |
| 1542 | **Death of Afonso I.** One of Africa's great rulers. His reign represents both the possibilities and the tragedy of early African-European encounter: genuine mutual interest corrupted by the slave trade. | Kongo | [E] |
| 1542-1568 | **Post-Afonso succession struggles.** Multiple ManiKongos in rapid succession. Portuguese influence grows. Slave trade continues to destabilize the kingdom. | Kongo | [E] |
| 1568 | **Jaga invasion.** The Kongo Kingdom is overrun by invaders called the "Jaga" (identity debated — possibly Yaka or Imbangala warriors from the interior). ManiKongo Álvaro I flees to an island in the Congo River. Portuguese military intervention helps restore him to power, but at the cost of increased dependence. | Kongo | [D] — Jaga identity debated |
| 1568-1587 | **Reign of Álvaro I.** Restored with Portuguese help after the Jaga invasion. Kongo becomes more dependent on Portuguese military and economic support. The slave trade is now deeply embedded in the political economy. | Kongo | [E] |
| c. 1580s-1600 | **Kongo's autonomous power wanes.** The kingdom persists (and will continue for centuries) but Portuguese economic penetration, the slave trade, and internal factionalism erode the centralized authority of the ManiKongo. | Kongo | [E] |

## Scholarly Debates

| Question | Position A | Position B | Current Consensus |
|----------|------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Why did Great Zimbabwe decline?** | Environmental degradation (deforestation, overgrazing, soil exhaustion) | Political fragmentation and trade route shifts | Likely a combination of factors; no single cause |
| **Great Zimbabwe construction dates** | Major building from c. 1100 CE (earliest estimates) | Main construction from c. 1270-1300 (later estimates) | Construction in phases; major work from c. 1220-1400; debate over precise phasing |
| **Who built Great Zimbabwe?** | Shona-speaking ancestors of the present population | ~~Phoenicians/Arabs/other non-Africans~~ (colonial-era racism) | **Definitively settled:** Built by ancestors of the Shona. Colonial theories were racist fabrications. |
| **Mapungubwe-Zimbabwe relationship** | Direct political succession (same dynasty, moved north) | Cultural continuity but distinct polities | Most scholars see cultural continuity but debate direct political links |
| **Kongo origins** | Founded c. 1390 by Lukeni lua Nimi | Kingdom developed gradually over a longer period | Traditional founding date accepted as approximate; actual formation may have been more gradual |
| **"Jaga" identity (1568)** | External invaders (Yaka, Imbangala, or others from the interior) | Internal rebellion mislabeled as foreign invasion | Debated; likely external invaders, but exact identity remains uncertain |

## For Fiction Writing

### The Zimbabwe Plateau World
- **Landscape:** Granite kopjes and balancing rocks; golden grasslands; scattered woodland; the escarpment dropping toward the Mozambique lowlands
- **Stone and cattle:** The two defining elements — dry-stone walls of the zimbabwe enclosures rising from the landscape; great herds of cattle as the ultimate measure of wealth
- **Sound:** Cattle lowing, ironworking hammers, the echo of voices in stone enclosures, birdsong in miombo woodland
- **Gold:** Not the primary economic base (cattle were more important) but the prestigious commodity that connected the plateau to the wider world

### The Kongo Kingdom
- **Tropical setting:** Lush plateau south of the Congo River; rich agricultural land; palm trees, tropical forest
- **Court culture:** Elaborate court rituals, woven raffia textiles (the famous "Kongo cloth"), ironwork, sophisticated political ceremony
- **The encounter:** Kongo-Portuguese first contact offers one of history's most dramatic culture-clash scenarios — two sophisticated civilizations meeting as (initially) equals
