# TL-02: East Africa Regional Timeline
## Swahili Coast, Indian Ocean Trade, and the Great Lakes (~300-1600 CE)

*This timeline covers the Swahili Coast city-states, Indian Ocean maritime trade connections, the Great Lakes region, and Portuguese disruption. The Swahili Coast represents one of Africa's most cosmopolitan civilizations — African in foundation, shaped by Indian Ocean connections, and devastated by European intervention.*

## Sources for East African Chronology

East African dating relies on a combination of:
- **Arabic accounts:** al-Mas'udi (c. 947), al-Idrisi (1154), Ibn Battuta (1331), and others
- **Portuguese accounts:** Post-1498 eyewitness reports (Barbosa, de Barros, others)
- **Archaeology:** Excavations at Kilwa, Shanga, Gedi, Manda, and other sites; imported Chinese ceramics provide useful dating markers
- **Swahili chronicles:** The *Kilwa Chronicle* and similar local histories, compiled later but drawing on oral tradition
- **Material culture:** Coin finds (Kilwa minted its own copper coinage), pottery sequences, architectural phases

**Note on the "Shirazi" question:** Many Swahili Coast ruling dynasties claimed "Shirazi" (Persian) origins. Modern scholarship largely interprets this as a prestige origin claim rather than evidence of actual Persian colonization. The Swahili Coast was fundamentally an African civilization — Bantu-speaking in language, African in material culture — that participated in Indian Ocean trade and selectively adopted elements of Islamic culture.

## Early Period (~300-699 CE)

| Date | Event | Polity/Context | Confidence |
|------|-------|----------------|------------|
| c. 1st century CE | **The *Periplus of the Erythraean Sea*** describes the East African coast ("Azania") and its trade with Arabia and India. Mentions the port of Rhapta (location unknown, possibly near modern Dar es Salaam). Provides evidence of ancient trade links predating our project period. | Pre-Swahili coast | [E] for text; [D] for Rhapta's location |
| c. 300-500 | **Early Iron Age communities** along the East African coast. Bantu-speaking farmers and fishers establish settlements. Local iron-smelting. Limited evidence of external trade contacts in this period. | Coastal settlements | [P] |
| c. 500-600 | **Proto-Swahili settlements emerge.** Small trading communities at sites like Shanga (Lamu Archipelago), Unguja Ukuu (Zanzibar), and the Comoros. Mix of fishing, farming, and small-scale Indian Ocean trade. | Early Swahili | [P] |
| c. 600s | **Indian Ocean trade contacts intensify.** The rise of Islam and the Umayyad/Abbasid caliphates stimulates maritime commerce across the Indian Ocean. East African communities begin to participate more actively. | Coastal trade | [P] |

## Middle Period (~700-1099 CE)

| Date | Event | Polity/Context | Confidence |
|------|-------|----------------|------------|
| c. 700-800 | **Swahili Coast urbanization begins.** Permanent stone and timber towns develop at multiple points along the coast from southern Somalia to northern Mozambique. Shanga, Manda, and Kilwa are among the earliest. | Swahili Coast | [E] |
| c. 760+ | **Shanga settlement established** on Pate Island (Lamu Archipelago). Mark Horton's excavations reveal a continuous occupation sequence from timber to stone construction, with early evidence of Islam. | Shanga | [E] |
| c. 780-800 | **Earliest mosque at Shanga** — one of the oldest on the East African coast. Small, simple structure; suggests Islam adopted by local elites through trade contacts, not conquest or mass migration. | Shanga | [E] |
| c. 800s | **Manda develops** as a trading town in the Lamu Archipelago. Evidence of imported goods from the Persian Gulf and India. | Manda | [E] |
| c. 800s | **Kilwa founded** on an island off the southern Tanzanian coast. Strategic position controlling the southern trade routes, particularly access to the gold trade from the Zimbabwe Plateau via Sofala. | Kilwa | [P] |
| c. 800-900 | **Arab and Persian merchant communities** establish residence in Swahili Coast towns. These are minority communities within African-governed towns, not colonizers. Intermarriage with local Bantu-speaking populations. | Swahili Coast | [P] |
| c. 800-1000 | **Swahili language develops** as a Bantu language with significant Arabic loanwords (especially for trade, religion, and navigation). Written in Arabic script (later). | Swahili Coast | [P] |
| c. 900s | **Indian Ocean trade network fully operational.** Monsoon-driven sailing connects East Africa with Arabia, Persia, India, and (via intermediaries) China. East Africa exports gold, ivory, iron, mangrove poles, slaves, ambergris, and leopard skins. Imports ceramics, glass beads, textiles, and luxury goods. | Indian Ocean trade | [E] |
| c. 947 | **al-Mas'udi writes about the "Land of Zanj"** in *Meadows of Gold*. Earliest major Arabic account of the East African coast. Describes trade, peoples, and the "king of the Zanj." | Swahili Coast | [E] |
| c. 1000 | **"Shirazi" dynasty established at Kilwa** according to the *Kilwa Chronicle*. Ali ibn al-Hassan, claimed to have come from Shiraz in Persia, allegedly purchased the island from its local ruler. Whether this reflects actual Persian migration or a prestige origin narrative is actively debated. | Kilwa | [D] |
| c. 1000-1100 | **Mogadishu emerges** as a major Swahili Coast city-state in the north. Strong connections to Arabian Peninsula trade. Develops as a hub for gold, ivory, and slave trade. | Mogadishu | [P] |
| c. 1000-1100 | **Coral stone construction** begins to replace timber and wattle-and-daub in wealthier Swahili towns. The shift to stone architecture marks increasing wealth and social stratification. | Swahili Coast | [E] |
| c. 1050-1100 | **Kilwa begins to dominate southern Swahili Coast trade.** Gains control over the port of Sofala (modern Mozambique), the outlet for Zimbabwe Plateau gold. This gold trade is the foundation of Kilwa's wealth. | Kilwa | [P] |

## High Period (~1100-1399 CE)

| Date | Event | Polity/Context | Confidence |
|------|-------|----------------|------------|
| c. 1100-1200 | **Swahili Coast towns flourish.** Stone mosques, multi-story houses with indoor plumbing, elaborate tombs. Kilwa, Mogadishu, Mombasa, Lamu, Malindi, Sofala, and dozens of smaller towns form an interconnected urban network. | Swahili Coast | [E] |
| c. 1100 | **Gedi (Gede) founded** on the Kenyan coast near Malindi. Will develop into a prosperous town with well-preserved stone houses, mosques, and a palace. | Gedi | [P] |
| 1154 | **al-Idrisi's geography** compiled for King Roger II of Sicily. Includes descriptions of the East African coast and Indian Ocean trade. | Swahili Coast | [E] |
| c. 1200 | **Kilwa begins minting copper coins** — evidence of a monetized economy and political authority. Among the few coinages in sub-Saharan Africa (alongside Aksumite coinage). | Kilwa | [E] |
| c. 1200-1300 | **Kilwa's Great Mosque expanded** into one of the largest and finest mosques on the Swahili Coast. Coral stone construction with vaulted ceilings. Multiple phases of rebuilding. | Kilwa | [E] |

| c. 1200-1400 | **Chinese ceramics reach the Swahili Coast** in significant quantities. Song and Yuan dynasty porcelain found at Kilwa, Gedi, and other sites — evidence of indirect (and possibly direct) trade connections to China. | Indian Ocean trade | [E] |
| c. 1200-1400 | **Peak of Swahili Coast prosperity.** The city-states form a loosely connected network united by Swahili language, Islam, maritime trade, and shared cultural practices. No single state dominates the entire coast, but Kilwa is the wealthiest in the south and Mogadishu in the north. | Swahili Coast | [E] |
| c. 1277 | **Abu al-Fida mentions Kilwa** as the principal city of the land of the Zanj, known for its gold trade. | Kilwa | [E] |
| c. 1310-1333 | **Reign of Sultan al-Hasan ibn Sulaiman at Kilwa.** Builds the enormous Husuni Kubwa palace — over 100 rooms, audience courts, a bathing pool, and commercial facilities. The largest pre-European stone building in sub-Saharan Africa. Kilwa at the peak of its wealth and power. | Kilwa | [P] |
| 1331 | **Ibn Battuta visits Kilwa.** Praises Sultan Abu al-Mawahib (or possibly al-Hasan ibn Sulaiman — identification debated) as generous and devout. Describes Kilwa as "one of the most beautiful and well-constructed towns in the world." Also visits Mogadishu and Mombasa. | Kilwa, Mogadishu, Mombasa | [E] |
| 1331 | **Ibn Battuta describes Mogadishu** in detail: its wealthy merchants, its cuisine (rice, unripe bananas, meat, vegetables), its textile industry, and its sultan's elaborate court ceremonies. | Mogadishu | [E] |
| c. 1340s-1350s | **Sultan Abu al-Mawahib rules Kilwa.** The sultan who hosted Ibn Battuta (if the visit is dated to his reign). Known for generosity and military campaigns against the mainland. | Kilwa | [P] |
| c. 1300-1400 | **Zanzibar develops** as a significant Swahili Coast settlement. The island's strategic position and agricultural potential make it increasingly important. | Zanzibar | [P] |
| c. 1300-1400 | **Swahili poetry tradition develops.** The earliest surviving Swahili poetry dates from later periods, but the literary tradition likely has roots in this era. Composed in Arabic script. | Swahili culture | [S] |
| c. 1300-1400 | **Great Lakes region polities develop.** The Kitara complex and early Bunyoro-Kitara kingdom in the interlacustrine region (modern Uganda). Cattle-based kingdoms with sophisticated political systems. Primarily known from oral tradition. | Great Lakes | [T] |
| c. 1350-1400 | **Decline of Kilwa's control over Sofala trade** begins. Political instability, competition from other ports, and possible shifts in Zimbabwe Plateau gold production. | Kilwa | [P] |

## Late Period (~1400-1600 CE)

| Date | Event | Polity/Context | Confidence |
|------|-------|----------------|------------|
| c. 1400s | **Swahili Coast city-states continue to trade** but political fragmentation increases. No single city dominates. Mombasa, Malindi, Kilwa, and Lamu compete for trade and influence. | Swahili Coast | [P] |
| c. 1400s | **Great Lakes kingdoms consolidate.** Bunyoro-Kitara at its most powerful in the interlacustrine region. Cattle wealth, iron-working, and tribute systems. | Great Lakes | [T] |
| c. 1400-1500 | **Gedi at its peak.** Well-planned town with stone houses (some with indoor plumbing), a palace, the Great Mosque, and a pillar tomb cemetery. Imported Chinese porcelain and Indian beads in abundance. | Gedi | [E] |
| 1498 | **Vasco da Gama reaches the East African coast.** Visits Mozambique Island, Mombasa (hostile reception), and Malindi (friendly reception, obtains a pilot for India). The beginning of Portuguese disruption of the Indian Ocean trade system. | Swahili Coast / Portuguese | [E] |
| 1498 | **Mombasa resists da Gama.** The sultan of Mombasa, wary of Portuguese intentions, refuses cooperation. Da Gama's account reveals a wealthy, sophisticated city. | Mombasa | [E] |
| 1498 | **Malindi welcomes da Gama** — the sultan of Malindi, a rival of Mombasa, allies with the Portuguese. Provides the pilot (possibly Ahmad ibn Majid, the famous Arab navigator — this is [Debated]) who guides da Gama to India. | Malindi | [E] for alliance; [D] for pilot identity |
| 1500 | **Pedro Álvares Cabral visits Kilwa.** Attempts to establish a trade agreement. Relations are initially peaceful but deteriorate. | Kilwa / Portuguese | [E] |
| 1502 | **Vasco da Gama's second voyage.** Forces the sultan of Kilwa, Ibrahim, to pay tribute to Portugal. Threat of bombardment. Beginning of Portuguese coercion on the Swahili Coast. | Kilwa / Portuguese | [E] |
| 1505 | **Francisco de Almeida sacks Kilwa.** Portuguese fleet attacks and loots the city. A puppet sultan installed. Fort built (Fort Santiago). Kilwa's independence effectively ended. | Kilwa | [E] |
| 1505 | **Portuguese attack Mombasa.** After Kilwa, Almeida's fleet sacks Mombasa. The city is burned. Enormous quantities of trade goods looted. | Mombasa | [E] |
| 1507 | **Portuguese establish factory at Mozambique Island.** Base for controlling the southern Swahili Coast and access to Zimbabwe Plateau gold via Sofala. | Portuguese / Sofala | [E] |
| c. 1507-1512 | **Portuguese establish presence at Sofala.** Build a fort to control the gold trade from the Zimbabwe Plateau interior. Trade relations with the Mutapa Empire's coastal tributaries. | Sofala / Portuguese | [E] |
| 1516 | **Duarte Barbosa writes his account** of the East African coast. Describes Swahili Coast cities, trade goods, and African-Portuguese interactions. Valuable eyewitness source despite European biases. | Swahili Coast | [E] |
| 1528 | **Mombasa sacked again** by the Portuguese under Nuno da Cunha. Pattern of repeated Portuguese violence against resisting Swahili cities. | Mombasa | [E] |
| c. 1530s-1540s | **Portuguese establish trading posts** along the Swahili Coast. Fort Jesus built at Mombasa later (1593). Portuguese demand tribute and attempt to monopolize Indian Ocean trade. | Swahili Coast / Portuguese | [E] |
| c. 1540s | **Gedi begins to decline.** Possibly due to Portuguese disruption of trade routes and/or pressure from Oromo migrations from the interior. Abandoned by the 17th century. | Gedi | [P] |
| c. 1550s-1580s | **Swahili Coast city-states adapt** to Portuguese presence. Some cooperate (Malindi), others resist (Mombasa). The Portuguese never fully control the coast — they dominate sea lanes and key ports but Swahili political and cultural life continues. | Swahili Coast | [E] |
| c. 1560-1590 | **Great Lakes kingdoms evolve.** Buganda begins its rise, while Bunyoro remains powerful. Rwanda and Burundi kingdoms develop. All primarily known from oral tradition for this period. | Great Lakes | [T] |
| c. 1587-1592 | **Zimba raids devastate the Swahili Coast.** Mainland warriors (possibly Maravi or related peoples from the Zambezi region) attack and sack Kilwa (1587), then move northward. Mombasa attacked. The raids cause massive destruction. | Swahili Coast / Zimba | [D] |
| 1588 | **Mir Ali Bey's Ottoman-allied expedition** arrives on the Swahili Coast. A Turkish corsair attempts to rally Swahili states against the Portuguese. Receives support from Mombasa but ultimately withdraws. Demonstrates Swahili states' willingness to seek allies against Portuguese domination. | Mombasa / Ottoman | [E] |
| 1589 | **Zimba reach Mombasa** and sack the city. Massive casualties. The Zimba then move toward Malindi but are defeated by the Segeju people (allied with the Portuguese). | Mombasa / Zimba | [P] |
| 1593 | **Fort Jesus built at Mombasa** by the Portuguese. Massive coral-stone fortress designed by Italian architect Giovanni Battista Cairati. Intended to permanently secure Portuguese control of the northern Swahili Coast. Will become the site of numerous sieges. | Mombasa / Portuguese | [E] |
| c. 1590-1600 | **Swahili Coast in decline** as an autonomous political force. Portuguese control of key ports, disruption of traditional trade routes, and the Zimba raids have severely weakened the city-states. Cultural and economic life continues but political independence is curtailed. | Swahili Coast | [E] |

## Thematic Notes

### The Indian Ocean Trade System

The Swahili Coast was embedded in one of the world's great trade networks. Key features:

- **Monsoon rhythm:** The northeast monsoon (November-March) brought ships south from Arabia and India; the southwest monsoon (April-September) carried them back. This annual cycle structured everything — trade seasons, diplomatic calendars, cultural exchange.
- **Exports:** Gold (from Zimbabwe Plateau via Sofala), ivory, iron, timber (mangrove poles for treeless Arabia), slaves, ambergris, rock crystal, leopard skins
- **Imports:** Textiles (Indian cloth, silk), ceramics (Chinese porcelain, Persian pottery), glass beads, metalware, spices
- **African agency:** Swahili merchants were active participants, not passive recipients. They controlled the coastal trade, set prices, and integrated foreign goods into African social and political systems.

### Swahili Identity

The Swahili were not Arab colonists or "mixed-race" peoples in any simple sense. Modern scholarship emphasizes:
- Swahili is a **Bantu language** (with Arabic loanwords)
- Swahili Coast material culture is **overwhelmingly African** in its archaeological profile
- Islam was **adopted and adapted** by Swahili communities, not imposed by foreign conquerors
- The "Shirazi" and "Arab" origin claims were **prestige narratives**, not demographic descriptions
- Swahili civilization was an African achievement that participated in global networks

### Portuguese Disruption

The Portuguese did not "discover" the Swahili Coast — they arrived at a sophisticated, centuries-old urban civilization. Their impact was:
- **Military:** Bombardment, sacking, and fort-building to coerce tribute
- **Economic:** Attempted monopoly of Indian Ocean trade, disrupting established networks
- **Political:** Installation of puppet rulers, playing city-states against each other
- **Limited cultural:** The Portuguese never converted the Swahili or fundamentally altered Swahili culture
- **Not total:** Portuguese control was always partial; they dominated sea lanes but Swahili life continued in many areas

## Scholarly Debates

| Question | Position A | Position B | Current Consensus |
|----------|------------|------------|-------------------|
| **"Shirazi" origins** | Ruling dynasties actually descended from Persian immigrants | "Shirazi" was a prestige identity claim by indigenous African elites | Majority view favors African origins with possible small-scale Persian contact |
| **When did Kilwa become dominant?** | c. 1000 CE, with "Shirazi" dynasty establishment | c. 1200 CE, with control of Sofala gold trade | Most scholars link Kilwa's rise to the gold trade (c. 1200+) |
| **Chinese direct trade?** | Chinese ships may have sailed directly to East Africa (Zheng He, 1418-1433) | Chinese goods reached East Africa through intermediary Arab and Indian traders | Most trade was indirect; Zheng He expeditions may have reached the coast |
| **Zimba identity** | Zimba were Maravi people from the Zambezi region | Zimba were a mixed warrior band of various origins | Identity remains uncertain; sources are thin and confused |
| **Great Lakes chronology** | State formation in Great Lakes region dates to c. 1200-1300 | Significant political complexity only from c. 1400+ | Debated; oral traditions suggest earlier complexity but archaeological evidence is limited |

## For Fiction Writing

### Atmospheric Notes
- **Sea:** The Swahili Coast world is defined by the ocean — the smell of salt air, the creak of dhow rigging, the rhythmic slap of waves on coral-stone quays
- **Architecture:** Coral-stone houses with carved wooden doors, inner courtyards, niches for oil lamps, coral-block mosques with whitewashed walls
- **Sounds:** The muezzin's call, the haggling of the market in Swahili-Arabic mixed speech, the creak of dhow rigging, monsoon rains on coral roofs
- **Smells:** Frankincense and myrrh, cloves and cardamom, drying fish, the tang of mangrove forests, cooking spices
- **Trade season:** The annual rhythm of monsoon arrivals — excitement when the dhow fleet appears on the horizon, the bustle of unloading, the competitive display of wealth
