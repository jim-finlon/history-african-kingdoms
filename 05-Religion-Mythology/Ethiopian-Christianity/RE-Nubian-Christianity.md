## Overview

The Christian kingdoms of Nubia represent one of the longest-enduring and most distinctive Christian civilizations in African history — and one of the most tragically forgotten. For over nine hundred years, from the official conversion missions of the sixth century to the final extinction of Christianity in the fifteenth or sixteenth century, the peoples of the Middle Nile valley maintained a sophisticated Christian culture that developed its own artistic traditions, produced literature in their own language, built hundreds of churches, and successfully preserved their independence against the expanding Islamic world for longer than any other Christian polity in the region.

Yet Nubian Christianity has largely vanished from both popular memory and much of the scholarly record. Unlike Ethiopian Christianity, which survives to the present day, Nubian Christianity left no living community to carry its memory forward. The written tradition was largely destroyed or lost; the churches crumbled into ruins; the frescoes that once adorned cathedral walls were buried under sand or submerged beneath the waters of the Aswan High Dam. Only in the twentieth century, through archaeological excavation — particularly the dramatic rescue missions before the Nile's flooding — did the full richness of Nubian Christian civilization begin to reemerge.

What the excavations revealed was remarkable: a Christian culture that was neither a pale imitation of Byzantine or Coptic models nor an isolated backwater, but a creative synthesis that developed distinctively Nubian forms of Christian expression. The Faras frescoes, with their dark-skinned saints and brilliant colors, their crowned kings protected by Christ and the Virgin, their distinctive iconographic programs, testified to a confident Christian civilization that saw itself as fully part of the universal church while expressing that faith in distinctively African forms. Nubian Christianity was an indigenous African Christianity — not something imposed from outside but something the Nubian peoples made their own.

## Conversion: The Rival Missions (~543 CE)

### The Pre-Christian Context

Before Christianity's arrival, the Nubian peoples practiced indigenous African religions with some influence from earlier Egyptian and Meroitic traditions. The ancient kingdom of Meroe (the Kushite state that succeeded Egypt's Nubian dynasty) had developed its own religious culture, including worship of the lion-god Apedemak and the Egyptian-influenced worship of Amun. [E] By the fifth century, however, Meroe had collapsed, and the Nubian Nile valley was divided among successor peoples who maintained various indigenous traditions.

Christianity was not entirely unknown in Nubia before the official conversion. Christian merchants and travelers had long passed through the region; Coptic monks from Egypt may have established small communities; and the Nobatian royal court may have had some Christian influence by the early sixth century. [P] But the systematic Christianization of Nubia began with the missionary expeditions of the mid-sixth century.

### The Byzantine Mission (c. 535-543 CE)

The first major missionary effort to Nubia came from the Byzantine Empire under Emperor Justinian I (r. 527-565 CE). [E] Justinian sought to extend Chalcedonian (Byzantine Orthodox) Christianity southward along the Nile, partly for religious reasons and partly to secure Byzantine influence in the region and counter potential Persian expansion.

A Byzantine mission was dispatched to the northern Nubian kingdom of Nobatia, arriving sometime around 535-543 CE. [P] The missionaries brought Chalcedonian Christianity — the form approved by the Council of Chalcedon (451 CE), which held that Christ had two natures (divine and human) united in one person.

### The Miaphysite Counter-Mission

The Byzantine mission did not proceed unchallenged. Empress Theodora, Justinian's wife, was a supporter of the Miaphysite position — the theological view that Christ had one united nature, divine and human combined (not two separate natures). This was the position of the Coptic Church of Egypt and the churches of Armenia and Ethiopia, rejected by the Council of Chalcedon and therefore considered heretical by the official Byzantine church.

According to the historian John of Ephesus, Theodora secretly sponsored a rival Miaphysite mission to Nubia, led by a priest named Julian. [P] John of Ephesus's account, while partisan (he was himself Miaphysite), provides the most detailed narrative of the conversion:

Theodora supposedly arranged for Julian's mission to reach Nobatia before the official Chalcedonian mission could arrive, by having the imperial authorities delay the Byzantine missionaries. Julian arrived in Nobatia around 543 CE and successfully converted the Nobatian king (whose name is not reliably preserved) to Miaphysite Christianity. [P]

### Longinus and the Mission to Alodia

The most significant figure in the Miaphysite missionary effort was Longinus, a bishop who continued the work that Julian had begun. [P] Around 569-575 CE, Longinus undertook a remarkable mission to Alodia, the southernmost Nubian kingdom centered on Soba near the confluence of the Blue and White Niles.

Longinus's journey was difficult. The kingdom of Makuria, which lay between Nobatia and Alodia, had apparently adopted Chalcedonian Christianity (or at least was not favorable to Miaphysite missionaries). Longinus had to bypass Makurian territory — possibly traveling through the desert or finding other routes — to reach Alodia. [P]

The mission succeeded: Alodia accepted Christianity in its Miaphysite form around 580 CE. [P] With this conversion, all three Nubian kingdoms were nominally Christian, though the theological division between Chalcedonian Makuria and Miaphysite Nobatia and Alodia created initial complications.

### The Royal Conversions

The conversion of Nubia followed the pattern common to early medieval Christianization: conversion of the king, followed by gradual conversion of the population. [E] In each case, the decision of the ruler to accept baptism was the key event; Christian identity then spread through royal patronage, church building, and the gradual displacement of earlier religious practices.

**Confidence Assessment:** The basic narrative of Nubian conversion is [P] Probable, derived primarily from John of Ephesus's account. However, John wrote as a partisan Miaphysite, and some details of his account may be exaggerated or simplified. The precise chronology and the names of specific Nubian rulers converted remain [D] Debated.

## The Three Kingdoms: Religious Identities

### Nobatia (Lower Nubia)

Nobatia, the northernmost Nubian kingdom, occupied the territory between the First and Second Cataracts of the Nile (roughly the region of Lower Nubia, now largely submerged by Lake Nasser). Its capital was at Faras (ancient Pachoras), which became the seat of the most important Nubian bishopric.

**Religious Character:** Nobatia adopted Miaphysite Christianity through the Julian/Longinus missions and maintained close ties to the Coptic Church of Alexandria. [P] The theological alignment reflected both geographical proximity to Egypt and the success of Theodora's sponsored mission.

**The Cathedral of Pachoras:** The Cathedral at Faras became the most important church in Lower Nubia, seat of the Bishop of Pachoras who held jurisdiction over the northern region. The building underwent multiple construction phases, with the final cathedral constructed around 707 CE. [E]

### Makuria (Middle Nubia)

Makuria, the central and ultimately dominant Nubian kingdom, was centered on Old Dongola (Nubian: Tungul) on the Nile's east bank. Initially a distinct kingdom, Makuria would eventually absorb Nobatia and become the primary Nubian power.

**Initial Chalcedonian Alignment:** Makuria apparently accepted Chalcedonian (Byzantine Orthodox) Christianity through the official imperial mission. [P] This created a theological division between Makuria and its Miaphysite neighbors — though how significant this division was in practice is [D] Debated.

**Shift to Miaphysite Tradition:** By the late seventh century, Makuria had aligned with the Miaphysite tradition and accepted the authority of the Coptic patriarch of Alexandria. [P] The timing and circumstances of this shift are unclear. It may have coincided with or followed the union of Nobatia and Makuria; it may reflect the practical reality that after the Arab conquest of Egypt (639-642 CE), the Coptic patriarch was the only readily accessible Christian authority.

**The Unification:** Sometime in the mid-seventh century — possibly in response to the Arab threat — Nobatia and Makuria merged under Makurian leadership. [E] The former Nobatian territory became the Eparchy (province) of Nobadia, governed from Faras by an eparch (governor) who was often a member of the royal family. This unified kingdom became the primary political expression of Nubian Christianity.

### Alodia (Upper Nubia)

Alodia, the southernmost Nubian kingdom, was centered on Soba, located near modern Khartoum where the Blue and White Niles converge. It was the largest of the three kingdoms in territory, though much of that territory was sparsely populated.

**Religious Character:** Alodia accepted Miaphysite Christianity through Bishop Longinus's mission around 580 CE. [P] Less is known about Alodia's religious development than about the northern kingdoms, partly because fewer archaeological sites have been excavated and partly because Arabic sources focused primarily on Makuria.

**Relationship with Makuria:** The religious and political relationship between Makuria and Alodia remains [D] Debated. Some sources suggest periods of unification or Makurian hegemony; others indicate that Alodia maintained substantial independence. The epithet "The New Constantine" given to the Makurian king [[HF-Merkurios|Merkurios]] (r. c. 697-710 CE) has been interpreted by some scholars as reflecting a unification of all the Nubian kingdoms under his rule. [D]

**Later History:** Alodia may have survived longer than Makuria as an independent Christian polity, though its ultimate fate is obscure. By the fifteenth or sixteenth century at the latest, Christianity had disappeared from the Soba region as well. [P]

## Theological Complexity

### The Chalcedonian-Miaphysite Division

The early theological division in Nubian Christianity reflects one of the great schisms of late antique Christianity. The Council of Chalcedon (451 CE) had defined Christ as having two natures (divine and human), united in one person but not mixed or confused. The Miaphysite position, held by the Coptic, Armenian, and Ethiopian churches, maintained that Christ had one united nature — divine and human combined — after the incarnation. [E]

This was not merely an abstract theological dispute. The Chalcedonian definition was associated with imperial (Byzantine) Christianity, while the Miaphysite position was associated with indigenous Egyptian Christianity (the Coptic Church) and its theological tradition. The choice between Chalcedonian and Miaphysite Christianity was also a choice about religious identity and political alignment.

**The Byzantine Connection:** Chalcedonian Christianity represented connection to Constantinople, the Byzantine Empire, and the broader Mediterranean Christian world. For Makuria initially, this alignment may have offered political and cultural benefits — access to Byzantine trade, diplomacy, and prestige.

**The Coptic Connection:** Miaphysite Christianity represented connection to Egypt's indigenous church, which had resisted Byzantine theological imperialism. For Nobatia and Alodia, the Coptic connection may have seemed more natural — geographically closer, culturally more familiar, and not associated with the imperial power that had sometimes treated Egypt's Christians harshly.

### The Resolution: Miaphysite Unity

By the early eighth century at the latest, all the Nubian kingdoms had aligned with the Miaphysite tradition and accepted the authority of the Coptic patriarch of Alexandria. [E] This resolution may reflect:

1. **The Arab Conquest:** After 642 CE, Byzantine power in Egypt was gone. The Chalcedonian option no longer carried imperial backing.

2. **Coptic Accessibility:** The Coptic patriarch remained in Alexandria under Arab rule. He was the only accessible authority who could appoint Nubian bishops and maintain ecclesiastical connection.

3. **Theological Affinity:** The Nubian churches may have found the Miaphysite theological tradition more congenial, or the distinction may have seemed less important than practical ecclesiastical unity.

4. **Political Unification:** The merger of Nobatia (Miaphysite) and Makuria (initially Chalcedonian) may have required theological accommodation. The Miaphysite tradition, being that of both Nobatia and the Coptic patriarch who would appoint bishops, may have prevailed.

### Ongoing Coptic Connection

Throughout its history, Nubian Christianity maintained formal subordination to the Coptic patriarch of Alexandria. [E] This connection was crucial:

**Appointment of Bishops:** The Coptic patriarch appointed bishops to Nubian sees. No Nubian bishop could take office without patriarchal appointment. This made the patriarch an essential figure in Nubian ecclesiastical governance, even though he resided in Muslim-ruled Egypt.

**Liturgical Tradition:** Nubian liturgy drew heavily on Coptic and Greek models. The liturgical languages (Greek, Coptic, and eventually Old Nubian) reflected this dual inheritance.

**Theological Authority:** The Miaphysite theological tradition, as interpreted and maintained by the Coptic church, provided the doctrinal framework for Nubian Christianity.

**Political Implications:** The patriarchal connection gave Nubia a channel of communication with Egypt that could sometimes be used for diplomatic purposes. Nubian kings occasionally intervened in Egyptian affairs to protect the Coptic patriarch from Mamluk persecution — most dramatically when King Cyriacus of Makuria marched an army into Egypt in 745-747 CE to secure the patriarch's release from imprisonment. [P]

## Cathedral Culture

### The Role of Cathedrals

Nubian Christianity was a cathedral Christianity. The bishop's church — the cathedral — served as the center of religious, administrative, and cultural life for each episcopal see. The great cathedrals of Nubia were not merely places of worship but symbols of Christian civilization, statements of Nubian identity, and repositories of artistic achievement.

### Faras Cathedral (Cathedral of Pachoras)

The Cathedral of Pachoras at Faras is the best-known Nubian church, thanks to the dramatic Polish archaeological expedition that excavated and documented it before the site was submerged by the Aswan High Dam in the 1960s. [E]

**Construction History:** The site had multiple building phases:
- An initial church (probably 6th century)
- An enlarged cathedral (early 8th century, perhaps c. 707 CE)
- Subsequent modifications and decorative campaigns

**Architecture:** The cathedral was built of mud-brick with some stone elements, featuring a basilica plan with nave and side aisles, an eastern apse, and various ancillary chambers. The walls were thick, providing insulation from the desert heat. [E]

**The Frescoes:** The cathedral's walls were covered with painted frescoes depicting saints, biblical scenes, angels, and royal figures. These paintings, preserved under sand for centuries, constitute the finest surviving examples of Nubian Christian art. Over 120 paintings were recovered, now divided between the National Museum of Sudan in Khartoum and the National Museum in Warsaw, Poland. [E]

**Episcopal Lists:** Inscriptions in the cathedral recorded the succession of bishops, providing crucial evidence for Nubian ecclesiastical history. These lists, in Greek and Coptic, allow scholars to reconstruct the episcopal succession at Faras (with gaps) over several centuries.

### Old Dongola Cathedral

The capital of Makuria had its own cathedral, along with multiple other churches that have been excavated by the Polish archaeological mission.

**The Church of the Granite Columns:** One of the major churches at Old Dongola, featuring columns of granite imported from considerable distance — evidence of the resources Nubian kings invested in church building. [P]

**The Throne Room Church:** The complex at Old Dongola included a building that combined palace and church functions — the throne room that was later converted to a mosque around 1312 CE, marking the definitive Islamization of the capital. [E]

**Other Churches:** Multiple church buildings have been excavated at Dongola, indicating a complex religious infrastructure appropriate to a royal capital.

### Qasr Ibrim

Qasr Ibrim, situated on a promontory above the Nile (now an island in Lake Nasser), served as an important fortified religious center. [E]

**The Cathedral:** The site had a substantial cathedral that functioned from the eighth century until the late medieval period.

**Manuscript Finds:** Qasr Ibrim has yielded the most significant collection of Nubian manuscripts, including texts in Old Nubian, Greek, and Coptic. These finds have been crucial for understanding Nubian literacy and religious practice.

**Episcopal Function:** Qasr Ibrim was the seat of a bishop, serving as a second major episcopal center in the northern region alongside Faras.

### Episcopal Organization

Nubian Christianity was organized into multiple episcopal sees (bishoprics), each with its own bishop appointed by the Coptic patriarch. [P]

**Known Sees:** Historical and archaeological evidence documents bishops at:
- Faras/Pachoras (the most important northern see)
- Qasr Ibrim (Primis)
- Old Dongola (the capital)
- Soba (capital of Alodia)
- Other sites whose names are partially preserved or debated

**Hierarchical Structure:** The bishop of Faras appears to have held a position of special importance in the northern region, possibly serving as metropolitan (archbishop) for Lower Nubia. The bishop of Dongola held similar importance for the Makurian heartland.

**Dependence on Alexandria:** Because bishops required patriarchal appointment, the Nubian church was vulnerable to any disruption of communications with Egypt. In the late period, when relations with Muslim Egypt deteriorated, the appointment of new bishops became increasingly difficult, contributing to the church's institutional collapse. [P]

## Religious Art: The Faras Legacy

### The Discovery

The discovery and rescue of the Faras frescoes represents one of the most dramatic episodes in twentieth-century archaeology. [E] When the Aswan High Dam was being constructed in the 1960s, it was clear that the rising waters of Lake Nasser would submerge countless archaeological sites in Lower Nubia. UNESCO organized an international rescue campaign, and Polish archaeologists led by Professor Kazimierz Michalowski excavated the Faras cathedral between 1961 and 1964.

What they found exceeded all expectations. Beneath the sand that had buried the abandoned cathedral, the walls retained their painted decoration — over 120 frescoes, preserved in the desert conditions, depicting the full range of Nubian Christian iconography.

### Characteristics of Nubian Religious Art

**African Features:** Unlike Byzantine art, which typically depicted figures with Mediterranean features, Nubian frescoes portrayed saints, kings, and biblical figures with distinctly African features — darker skin, broader noses, and physical characteristics reflecting the Nubian population. [E] This was not artistic incompetence or deviation from "correct" models but a deliberate choice to represent Christianity in Nubian terms.

**Color and Decoration:** Nubian paintings employed vibrant colors — reds, yellows, blues, and greens — applied in distinctive combinations. Figures were richly decorated with patterned robes, elaborate jewelry, and royal regalia. The overall effect was of brilliance and splendor. [E]

**Iconographic Programs:** The paintings followed recognizable Christian iconographic conventions (Christ in majesty, the Virgin and Child, saints and angels) while developing distinctive Nubian variations. Certain subjects were particularly emphasized in Nubian art:

- **Protection themes:** Images of saints or Christ protecting royal figures were prominent, reflecting the close connection between church and kingship.
- **The Three Youths in the Furnace:** The biblical story of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego (Daniel 3) appeared frequently, perhaps as a symbol of faith preserved under pressure.
- **Archangel Michael:** The warrior archangel was particularly popular, reflecting both his role as protector and perhaps resonances with indigenous warrior traditions.

**Royal Portraits:** Several Faras frescoes depict Nubian royalty, shown with full regalia (crowns, robes, jewelry) and often protected by Christ, the Virgin, or saints. These are among our best visual evidence for how Nubian kings presented themselves — as Christian monarchs whose authority was divinely sanctioned.

### Artistic Influences and Originality

Nubian Christian art drew on multiple traditions:

**Byzantine Influence:** The basic iconographic vocabulary — how to depict Christ, the Virgin, saints, and biblical scenes — derived ultimately from Byzantine models, transmitted through Egypt. [P]

**Coptic Influence:** More immediately, Nubian artists learned from and were influenced by Coptic Egyptian art, which had its own distinctive style within the broader Byzantine tradition. [P]

**Indigenous Elements:** Nubian art was not merely derivative. The distinctive representation of figures with African features, certain decorative patterns, and the overall sensibility reflected indigenous Nubian artistic traditions and choices. [P]

**Development Over Time:** The Faras paintings span several centuries, allowing scholars to trace stylistic development. Earlier paintings (8th-9th centuries) tend to be more linear and hieratic; later paintings (10th-12th centuries) show greater naturalism and emotional expression. [P]

### What Was Lost

The rescue of the Faras frescoes saved a fraction of what once existed. Hundreds of Nubian churches once had painted walls; only a tiny sample survives. Many sites were not excavated before the dam's waters rose; others had already lost their paintings to time and decay.

The Faras collection, though magnificent, represents a single cathedral. We can only imagine what the cumulative artistic heritage of Nubian Christianity — the paintings in the cathedral of Old Dongola, in the churches of Soba, in the countless smaller churches along the Nile — might have revealed. That artistic tradition, developed over nine centuries, is largely lost forever.

## Liturgy and Practice

### Liturgical Languages

Nubian Christianity employed multiple languages in worship:

**Greek:** The primary liturgical language inherited from the Byzantine and Coptic traditions. Church services were conducted largely in Greek, the classical language of Eastern Christianity. Inscriptions, especially early ones, were often in Greek. [E]

**Coptic:** The Egyptian Christian language, derived from ancient Egyptian written in Greek script. Coptic was used liturgically and for ecclesiastical documents. The connection to the Coptic patriarch ensured that Coptic remained important in Nubian church life. [E]

**Old Nubian:** The vernacular language of the Nubian peoples, eventually written in a script adapted from Greek and Coptic. Old Nubian was used for translations of religious texts and, increasingly, for church purposes. This represents an important indigenization of Christianity — making the faith accessible in the people's own language. [E]

### The Nubian Rite

Nubian liturgy followed the general patterns of Eastern Christianity but apparently developed its own distinctive features — a "Nubian rite" comparable to the various other Eastern Christian liturgical traditions. [P]

**Sources:** Our knowledge of Nubian liturgy comes from:
- Manuscript fragments found at Qasr Ibrim and other sites
- Inscriptions in churches
- Artistic depictions of liturgical scenes
- Comparative analysis with Coptic and Byzantine practice

**Characteristics:** The Nubian rite appears to have been:
- Eucharistic (centered on the celebration of communion)
- Using Greek and/or Old Nubian for major prayers
- Following a liturgical calendar similar to the Coptic church
- Incorporating local elements whose specific nature is often unclear [P]

### Old Nubian Religious Texts

The discovery of Old Nubian manuscripts has revealed that Nubian Christians translated significant religious literature into their own language. [E]

**Biblical Texts:** Portions of the Bible were translated into Old Nubian. How complete these translations were is uncertain — we have fragments, not complete manuscripts — but the existence of vernacular scripture indicates serious engagement with making Christianity accessible to Nubian speakers. [P]

**The Miracle of Saint Menas:** One of the better-preserved Old Nubian texts is an account of miracles attributed to Saint Menas, an Egyptian martyr particularly venerated in the Coptic world. The existence of this text in Old Nubian shows the transmission of Coptic hagiographic tradition into Nubian vernacular. [E]

**Church History:** Qasr Ibrim yielded a nearly complete Old Nubian translation of the *Life of Aaron*, a work of church history. This demonstrates that Nubian readers had access to substantial religious literature in their own language. [E]

**Liturgical Texts:** Some liturgical texts (prayers, hymns) survive in Old Nubian, indicating that the language was used not only for private reading but for worship. [P]

### Religious Practice

Beyond formal liturgy, Nubian Christianity involved various religious practices:

**The Sacraments:** Baptism, Eucharist, and other sacraments were presumably celebrated according to patterns similar to Coptic practice, though specific Nubian details are largely unrecorded. [P]

**Saints' Cults:** The veneration of saints was central to Nubian piety, as reflected in the art. Saints served as intercessors, protectors, and models of Christian life. Some saints (like Michael the Archangel and the Virgin Mary) were particularly emphasized. [E]

**Pilgrimage:** Whether Nubians made pilgrimage to holy sites (Jerusalem, Egyptian monasteries) is unclear from the evidence. The logistics would have been challenging given Nubia's position beyond the Islamic world. [S]

**Religious Calendar:** The Nubian church presumably followed a liturgical calendar marking the major Christian feasts (Christmas, Easter, Pentecost, saints' days), though the specific Nubian observances are not well documented. [P]

---

## Monasticism

### The Presence of Monasteries

Monasticism was an important element of Nubian Christianity, though our knowledge of it remains limited. [P]

**Archaeological Evidence:** Several sites in Nubia have been identified as monasteries, based on architectural layout (buildings grouped around a central church, evidence of communal living) and inscriptional evidence. [P]

**Textual References:** Arabic sources occasionally mention Nubian monks, and Coptic sources reference the connection between Egyptian and Nubian monasticism. [P]

### Connections to Egyptian Monasticism

Nubian monasticism was almost certainly influenced by the powerful Egyptian monastic tradition. [P] Egypt was the birthplace of Christian monasticism, and the great Egyptian monasteries (St. Anthony's, St. Paul's, Wadi Natrun) were the spiritual centers of the Coptic world.

**Institutional Connection:** Nubian monks may have trained in Egyptian monasteries; Egyptian monks may have served in Nubia. The patriarchal connection ensured ongoing contact between Nubian and Egyptian monasticism. [S]

**Ascetic Tradition:** The monastic ideals of prayer, poverty, chastity, and withdrawal from the world that characterized Egyptian monasticism presumably shaped Nubian practice as well. [P]

### Monastic Functions

Monasteries in Nubia likely served multiple functions:

**Spiritual Centers:** Places of intense prayer and devotion, where monks maintained the cycle of liturgical hours and interceded for the Christian community. [P]

**Education:** Monks were typically literate, and monasteries may have served as centers of education, training clergy and copying manuscripts. [S]

**Hospitality:** Monasteries often provided hospitality to travelers in medieval Christianity. [S]

**Economic Role:** Monasteries may have controlled agricultural land and engaged in economic activity, as was common in medieval monastic practice. [S]

**Confidence Note:** Our knowledge of Nubian monasticism is limited by the paucity of sources. The existence of monasteries is [P] Probable, but details of their organization, daily life, and development remain largely [S] Speculative.

## Church Architecture

### The Nubian Church Plan

Nubian churches developed a distinctive architectural form adapted to local conditions and materials. [E]

**Basic Plan:** The typical Nubian church was a basilica — a rectangular building with a central nave and side aisles, an eastern apse (semicircular recess) containing the altar, and various ancillary chambers. This basic plan derived from Mediterranean church architecture but was adapted to Nubian conditions. [E]

**Building Materials:** Nubian churches were built primarily of mud-brick, the standard building material of the Nile valley. Some churches incorporated stone elements, particularly for columns and architectural details, but fired mud-brick predominated. [E]

**Roofing:** Churches were roofed with wooden beams (palm logs or imported timber) supporting a flat roof or vaulted construction. Flat roofs were typical, suited to the minimal rainfall of the region. [P]

**Walls:** Walls were thick, providing insulation from the desert heat and structural stability. The thick walls created a cool, dim interior — a refuge from the fierce Nubian sun. [E]

**Painted Decoration:** Interior walls were plastered and then painted with frescoes. The paintings covered substantial wall surfaces, creating an immersive visual environment for worship. [E]

### Architectural Development

Nubian church architecture developed over time:

**Early Period (6th-7th centuries):** Initial churches were often small, simple structures. Building techniques were being established, and architectural traditions were not yet fully developed. [P]

**Middle Period (8th-11th centuries):** The great era of Nubian church building. Larger, more elaborate churches were constructed, with refined architectural forms and extensive painted decoration. This period corresponds to Makuria's political and cultural florescence. [E]

**Late Period (12th-14th centuries):** Continued church construction, but perhaps on a smaller scale as the kingdom declined. Some earlier churches were modified or rebuilt. The conversion of the Old Dongola throne room to a mosque (c. 1312) marks the symbolic end of royal Christian patronage. [P]

### Fortified Churches

Some Nubian churches, particularly in frontier areas, incorporated defensive features. [P]

**Qasr Ibrim:** The site at Qasr Ibrim was a fortified position, and its churches existed within a defensive context.

**Strategic Locations:** Churches were sometimes built in locations that offered natural defensive advantages — hilltops, promontories, or positions that could be fortified.

**Interpretation:** The existence of fortified religious sites may reflect the insecurity of the frontier zone with Muslim Egypt, or more general concerns about protection in a region where raiding and warfare were periodic threats. [S]

### Church Sites Along the Nile

Archaeological surveys have documented numerous church sites along the Nubian Nile. The density of churches indicates that Christianity was thoroughly institutionalized — that even relatively small communities had their own places of worship.

Many of these churches are now destroyed or submerged. The Aswan High Dam flooded vast stretches of Lower Nubia, including many church sites that were documented but could not be fully excavated before the waters rose.

## The Baqt Treaty: Religious Dimensions

### The Framework

The Baqt treaty of 652 CE, negotiated between Makuria and the Arab-Muslim state after the failed Arab invasions, had significant religious implications. [E]

**Preservation of Christian Sovereignty:** The Baqt recognized Makuria as an independent, non-Muslim state. Unlike conquered populations who became *dhimmi* (protected non-Muslims under Islamic law), Nubians retained full sovereignty over their own territory and religious affairs.

**No Forced Conversion:** The Baqt did not require Nubian conversion to Islam or even encourage it. Nubian Christianity was protected by the treaty framework.

**The Coptic Connection:** The Baqt implicitly protected the Nubian church's connection to the Coptic patriarch in Arab-ruled Egypt. Nubians could maintain ecclesiastical ties across the treaty boundary.

### Religious Coexistence

The Baqt created a framework for long-term coexistence between a Christian kingdom and the Islamic caliphate — something unique in early Islamic expansion. [E]

**Mutual Recognition:** Each side recognized the other's religious legitimacy for diplomatic purposes. This did not mean theological acceptance — Muslims considered Nubian Christianity in error, and Nubians presumably regarded Islam similarly — but it meant practical coexistence.

**Trade and Contact:** The Baqt permitted trade between Nubia and Egypt, which meant ongoing contact between Christian and Muslim communities. This contact may have facilitated the gradual Islamic influence that eventually undermined Nubian Christianity. [P]

**The Annual Exchange:** The most controversial provision — the annual Nubian provision of enslaved people to Egypt and Egyptian provision of goods to Nubia — had religious dimensions as well. The enslaved people were presumably non-Christians captured from Nubia's wars with neighboring peoples (not Nubian Christians themselves), but the provision facilitated a flow of human beings from the Christian to the Islamic world. [D]

### Long-Term Implications

The Baqt's religious implications evolved over six centuries:

**The Early Period:** Initially, the Baqt protected a strong, confident Christian kingdom. Nubian Christianity flourished under this protection.

**The Middle Period:** As Arab nomadic groups infiltrated Nubian territory and intermarried with the population, Islam gradually spread within Nubian lands. The Baqt did not prevent this demographic change. [P]

**The Late Period:** By the thirteenth century, the Baqt framework was breaking down. Mamluk Egypt adopted an increasingly aggressive posture toward Nubia, ultimately destroying Makurian independence. The treaty that had protected Nubian Christianity became irrelevant as the kingdom itself collapsed. [E]

---

## Decline and Fall

### The Erosion of Christian Nubia

The decline of Nubian Christianity was a gradual process, not a sudden catastrophe. [E] Multiple factors contributed:

**Arab Nomadic Infiltration:** Beginning in the twelfth century, Arab Bedouin groups (particularly the Banu Kanz, Juhayna, and related tribes) migrated into Nubian territory from Egypt. These migrations were not military conquests but demographic movements — families and clans seeking new pastures and opportunities. The nomads intermarried with Nubian populations, brought Islam, and gradually changed the religious and cultural character of the region. [E]

**Intermarriage and Conversion:** As Arab Muslims married into Nubian families, Islam spread through family networks. Children of mixed marriages were typically raised as Muslims. Individual conversions, whether for economic advantage, marriage, or conviction, steadily increased the Muslim population. [P]

**Economic Disruption:** The nomadic infiltration disrupted the settled agricultural economy that had supported the Makurian state and its church. As pastoralism replaced agriculture in some areas, the economic base for maintaining churches, clergy, and episcopal organization eroded. [P]

**Political Instability:** The Makurian royal house experienced repeated succession crises in the thirteenth century. Rival princes sought external support — including from Mamluk Egypt — to press their claims. Each intervention weakened royal authority and, by extension, the institutional support for the church. [E]

### The Mamluk Invasions (1272-1317)

The series of Mamluk invasions documented in [[BC-Mamluk-Makuria-1272-1317]] dealt the death blow to Makurian independence and, ultimately, to Nubian Christianity.

**King [[HF-David-of-Makuria|David's]] Defiance:** King David's attacks on Mamluk positions (c. 1270-1272) triggered a devastating Mamluk response. Sultan Baybars sent an army that captured Old Dongola, destroyed its fortifications, and installed puppet rulers.

**Repeated Interventions:** The Mamluks intervened repeatedly in Makurian affairs (1272, 1276, 1287, 1290s, 1316-1317), each time weakening the kingdom further.

**The Installation of Muslim Rulers:** In 1316-1317, the Mamluks installed Abdullah Barshambu, a Muslim, as king of Makuria. For the first time, the throne of Christian Makuria was occupied by a Muslim. [E]

**The Throne Room Mosque:** Around 1312, the throne room of the royal palace at Old Dongola was converted into a mosque. This symbolic transformation marked the Islamization of the royal center. [E]

### The End of Institutional Christianity

The collapse of Christian royal authority meant the end of institutional support for the church:

**No New Bishops:** As relations with Egypt deteriorated and Nubian Christianity lost state backing, the appointment of new bishops became increasingly difficult. When existing bishops died, they were not replaced. Episcopal succession — essential to maintaining the church as an institution — collapsed. [P]

**Abandoned Churches:** Without royal patronage and clerical leadership, churches fell into disuse. Some were converted to mosques; others simply crumbled. The magnificent painted interiors were buried under sand or destroyed by time. [P]

**Private Christianity:** Christianity persisted as a private faith among some families and communities even after the institutional church collapsed. But without clergy, without bishops, without the sacraments that required ordained priests, this private Christianity could not reproduce itself indefinitely. [P]

### The Final Disappearance

The precise end point of Nubian Christianity is uncertain:

**Late Attestation:** Some Arabic sources mention Christians in the former Makurian territories as late as the fifteenth century. [P]

**Alodia's Fate:** The southern kingdom of Alodia may have survived as a Christian polity longer than Makuria, but it too eventually succumbed. By the fifteenth or sixteenth century, Christianity had effectively disappeared from the Soba region as well. [P]

**No Surviving Community:** Unlike Ethiopian Christianity, which survived and flourishes today, Nubian Christianity left no living community. By the time European travelers and scholars began documenting the region in the nineteenth century, Nubian Christianity was a dead tradition, known only through ruins and fragmentary memories. [E]

## What Was Lost

### The Disappearance from Memory

The extinction of Nubian Christianity was remarkably complete. Not only did the institutional church die, but the memory of Nubian Christian civilization largely faded as well.

**In European Memory:** Medieval Europe had vague knowledge of Christian kingdoms in the Nile valley — the legend of Prester John sometimes conflated Ethiopia and Nubia — but specific knowledge of Nubian Christianity did not survive in European tradition.

**In Islamic Memory:** Arabic sources preserved accounts of Nubia, but from a Muslim perspective focused on political and economic matters. The internal religious life of Nubian Christianity was of little interest to Muslim chroniclers.

**In Local Memory:** Among the descendants of Christian Nubians — now Muslims speaking Arabic rather than Old Nubian — some fragmentary memories may have persisted (traditions about ancestors who were Christians, about churches now ruins), but no continuous tradition of Nubian Christianity survived.

### The Archaeological Recovery

The recovery of Nubian Christian civilization has been a twentieth-century achievement, largely dependent on archaeology:

**Early Exploration:** European explorers and archaeologists began documenting Nubian ruins in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, but the full significance of Christian Nubia was not yet appreciated.

**The UNESCO Campaign:** The construction of the Aswan High Dam in the 1960s prompted the greatest archaeological rescue operation in history. International teams raced to document and excavate sites before the rising waters. [E]

**The Faras Revelation:** The Polish excavation of Faras cathedral (1961-1964) was the most dramatic discovery, revealing the magnificent frescoes that demonstrated the artistic achievements of Nubian Christianity. [E]

**Ongoing Research:** Archaeological work at Old Dongola, Qasr Ibrim, and other sites continues to expand our knowledge of Nubian Christianity, though many questions remain unanswered.

### The Significance of Loss

The loss of Nubian Christianity matters for several reasons:

**For African History:** Nubian Christianity represents one of the great African civilizations — a millennium of sophisticated culture, art, literature, and religious development. Its disappearance from memory impoverished our understanding of African history.

**For Christian History:** Nubian Christianity was one of the distinctive expressions of the Christian faith, developing its own artistic tradition, its own liturgical practices, and its own theological emphases. Its extinction reduced the diversity of Christian experience.

**For Human Heritage:** The artistic achievements of Nubian Christianity — the Faras frescoes being only the most famous examples — represent irreplaceable human cultural achievement. Most of this heritage is lost forever.

## For Fiction Writing

### Dramatic Potential

Nubian Christianity offers rich material for historical fiction, combining religious devotion, political drama, cultural distinctiveness, and tragic decline.

**The Long Arc:** Nine centuries of history provide ample scope for narrative. Stories could be set at various points along that arc — the initial conversion, the golden age of the eighth and ninth centuries, the long twilight of the thirteenth and fourteenth, or the final extinction.

**Faith Under Pressure:** The defining situation of Nubian Christianity was maintaining the faith while surrounded by an expanding Islamic world. This created constant tension — not usually dramatic persecution, but the steady pressure of demographic change, the anxiety of a shrinking community, the question of whether the next generation would still believe.

**Cultural Identity:** Nubian Christians had a distinctive identity — neither Byzantine nor Coptic but something of their own. Stories can explore what it meant to be Nubian and Christian, how these identities reinforced or complicated each other.

**The Extinction Theme:** The eventual disappearance of Nubian Christianity offers tragic possibilities. Stories can explore the last generations of believers, the final priests, the moment when a thousand-year tradition simply ends.

### Sensory Details

**Cathedral Interiors:**
- The dim, cool interior of a Nubian church, a refuge from the desert heat outside
- Thick mud-brick walls creating a womb-like enclosure
- The glow of oil lamps and candles illuminating painted walls
- Frescoes covering every surface — saints with dark skin gazing down from heaven, Christ in majesty above the altar, the Virgin protecting the king
- The smell of incense (frankincense from the Red Sea trade), the sweetness of beeswax candles
- The sound of chant — Greek liturgical phrases, responses in Old Nubian, the voices echoing in the enclosed space
- The congregation gathered for the Eucharist: nobles and farmers, women and children, the king in his special place
- The bishop in his vestments, the deacons assisting, the ancient rituals performed as they had been for centuries

**The Faras Style:**
- Figures painted with rich colors — deep reds, brilliant yellows, blues made from precious pigments
- Saints depicted with African features: dark skin, broad noses, full lips
- Robes decorated with elaborate patterns, jewelry dripping with gold and gems (real or painted)
- Protective images: Christ or the Virgin placing a hand on the king's shoulder, archangel Michael with sword drawn against invisible enemies
- The paint surface, smooth and bright, reflecting lamplight

**The Nile-Side Setting:**
- The great river flowing past, the source of all life in this land
- Date palms along the bank, their fronds providing shade
- Churches rising from mud-brick villages, their crosses visible against the sky
- The narrow green strip of cultivation, then desert immediately beyond
- Fishermen on the river, farmers in the fields, the routines of Nile valley life continuing around the sacred spaces

**Desert Christianity:**
- The church as oasis — cool interior, water for baptism, community in a vast empty land
- The silence of the desert contrasting with the sound of worship
- Stars at night, clear in the dry air — the same stars the patriarchs and apostles saw
- The horizon always visible, the sense of standing in a small green place surrounded by endless tan emptiness

### Religious Festivals

**Easter (Pascha):**
- The climax of the liturgical year, celebrating Christ's resurrection
- Vigil services through the night, the congregation waiting for dawn
- The proclamation of resurrection, joy replacing the somber tone of Lent
- Feasting after weeks of fasting, the community gathering to celebrate

**Feast of the Virgin:**
- The Theotokos (God-bearer) was particularly venerated in Nubian Christianity
- Processions, special liturgies, invocations of Mary's protection
- The king processing to the cathedral, his devotion to the Virgin displayed publicly

**Saints' Days:**
- The liturgical calendar punctuated by saints' commemorations
- Local saints alongside universal ones
- Stories told of miracles, martyrdoms, holy lives — the saints as present friends, not distant figures

**Baptisms:**
- Entry into the Christian community through water and Spirit
- Infants brought to the font by parents and godparents
- The bishop or priest performing the ancient rite: immersion, anointing, the white garment
- The joy of family, the expansion of the Christian community

### Monks and Bishops

**The Monk:**
- A figure of ascetic dedication, withdrawn from the world but praying for it
- Simple clothing (white cotton, perhaps a leather belt), plain food, disciplined life
- Rising before dawn for prayers, manual labor during the day, reading and meditation
- The cell where he lives, the monastery's church where he worships, the community of fellow monks
- Perhaps educated, able to read Greek and Old Nubian, a copyist of manuscripts
- Perhaps a holy man to whom villagers bring problems, seeking blessing and intercession

**The Bishop:**
- The leader of the local church, appointed by the Coptic patriarch
- Liturgical vestments: rich robes, episcopal staff, mitre or crown
- Authority to ordain priests, confirm the baptized, celebrate the full liturgy
- A figure of political as well as religious significance — advisor to the king, intermediary with the patriarch
- Perhaps resident in the cathedral city, perhaps traveling his diocese to visit outlying churches
- The pastoral burden: responsibility for souls, concern for the church's survival

**The Priest:**
- The ordinary clergyman serving a village church
- Celebrates the liturgy, baptizes, buries, hears confessions
- Often married (the Nubian church, like the Eastern churches generally, permitted married clergy)
- Perhaps semi-literate, knowing the liturgy by heart rather than reading it
- The face of Christianity for ordinary people, the intermediary between the community and the heavenly powers

### The Slow Decline

**A Generation After the Fall:**
- The king is Muslim now; the court has changed
- Churches still stand, but fewer people attend
- The bishop died years ago; no replacement has come from Alexandria
- Young people increasingly see their future in the new order
- The old faithfuls who remember the great days, gathering in diminishing numbers
- The paintings on the walls still beautiful, but no one commissions new ones

**The Last Priest:**
- An old man, perhaps the last ordained priest for miles
- He still celebrates the liturgy, though his congregation has shrunk to a handful
- He knows there will be no successor — no bishop to ordain one
- The sacraments will die with him; after him, only memory
- His prayers for the faith, for his people, for some miracle that does not come

**A Grandson Becomes Muslim:**
- A family scene: grandmother Christian, grandson converting to Islam
- Not persecution but the logic of a changing world — marriage opportunities, economic advantage, the future
- The grandmother who remembers the old faith, the grandson who sees it as the past
- Neither is wrong; both are heartbreaking
- The continuity of family across religious change, and the discontinuity within it

**The Last Christians:**
- A small community, perhaps in a remote area, maintaining the faith after the institutional church has died
- No priests, no bishops, no sacraments — only memories and practices passed down
- Gathering in a ruined church or a private home
- Prayers in Old Nubian that the speakers may no longer fully understand
- The knowledge that they are the end, that their children will not continue
- And then silence

## Scholarly Debates

| Question | Position A | Position B | Current Consensus |
|----------|------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Depth of Christianization** | Christianity penetrated deeply into Nubian society; most of the population was genuinely Christian | Christianity was primarily an elite religion; much of the population retained indigenous beliefs | Probably varied by region and period; Christianity more rooted in urban/church areas than remote regions [D] |
| **Reasons for decline** | External pressure (Arab infiltration, Mamluk invasions) destroyed Nubian Christianity | Internal factors (economic decline, political instability, lack of indigenous clergy) were primary | Both external and internal factors contributed; they reinforced each other [P] |
| **Theological significance of Chalcedonian-Miaphysite division** | The early division was significant and shaped Nubian religious identity | The distinction mattered little in practice; it was resolved early and had minimal lasting impact | The resolution in favor of Miaphysite unity was significant; the initial division's impact is debated [D] |
| **Relationship between Makuria and Alodia** | The kingdoms were unified under Makurian hegemony for extended periods | Alodia maintained substantial independence throughout | Evidence suggests varying degrees of Makurian influence; full unification is not clearly documented [D] |
| **Date of Christianity's extinction** | Christianity effectively ended by the mid-15th century | Isolated Christian communities survived into the 16th century or later | Christianity as an institutional presence ended by the late 14th/early 15th century; isolated survivals are possible but undocumented [P] |
| **The role of the Baqt in preserving Christianity** | The Baqt was essential; without it, Nubia would have been conquered and Christianized much earlier | The Baqt delayed but did not prevent eventual Islamization; internal factors would have led to religious change regardless | The Baqt provided crucial protection for centuries; its breakdown coincided with Christianity's decline [P] |

### Unresolved Questions

- **Indigenous Religious Survivals:** To what extent did pre-Christian religious practices survive beneath the Christian overlay? Were there Nubian Christians who secretly maintained earlier traditions?

- **Women in Nubian Christianity:** The evidence for women's religious roles is limited. Were there female monastics? How did ordinary women experience Nubian Christianity?

- **Nubian Theology:** Did Nubian Christians develop distinctive theological ideas, or did they simply receive theology from the Coptic world? No Nubian theological texts survive to answer this question.

- **The End:** What exactly happened in the final generations of Nubian Christianity? When did the last bishop die? When was the last Eucharist celebrated? These questions cannot be answered from surviving evidence.

### Source Assessment

**What We Know Well:**
- The existence of Nubian Christianity for approximately nine centuries [E]
- The basic framework of conversion, ecclesiastical organization, and decline [E]
- The artistic tradition, especially from Faras [E]
- The political history of the Christian kingdoms [E]

**What Remains Uncertain:**
- The depth of Christianization in the population
- The specific liturgical practices of the Nubian church
- The internal intellectual and theological life of Nubian Christianity
- The precise mechanisms and timing of Christianity's final extinction
- The Nubian perspective on their own history (no indigenous narratives survive)

**The Fundamental Problem:**
Nubian Christianity left no living community to transmit its memory. We depend almost entirely on archaeology (which reveals material culture but not belief) and Arabic sources (which represent an outside, often hostile perspective). The voice of Nubian Christians themselves is almost entirely lost.
