## Overview

The Mali Empire's social organization represents one of the most sophisticated and enduring social systems in West African history. Built on foundations that predated the empire's political formation, Mande social structure organized people into hierarchical but interdependent categories based on birth, occupation, and spiritual power. This system persists in modified form among Mande-speaking peoples today, offering both a window into the medieval past and a reminder that "history" and "present" are not always separable in African studies. The challenge for historians is distinguishing what the social system looked like in Sundiata's thirteenth century from what ethnographers documented in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

At its core, Mande society divided people into three broad categories: the *horon* (freeborn, often translated as "nobles"), the *nyamakala* (occupational specialists including blacksmiths, griots, and leatherworkers), and the *jon* (enslaved and servile persons). These were not merely economic classes but ritual categories defined by relationships to *nyama*, the spiritual power that flowed through the universe and could be concentrated, wielded, or endangered by human action. The nyamakala possessed and manipulated nyama through their crafts; the horon avoided contamination by such work; the jon existed outside the normal structures of honor and shame. Yet these categories were also interdependent: the horon needed the nyamakala to make their tools, sing their praises, and conduct their rituals, while the nyamakala depended on horon patronage for their livelihood.

This document reconstructs what can reasonably be inferred about Mali's social organization during the empire's height (c. 1235-1450 CE), while acknowledging that much of our evidence comes from sources — oral traditions, Arabic travelers, and later ethnography — that each carry their own limitations and biases. The Sundiata epic, our richest source for Mande social ideology, was recorded in written form only in the twentieth century and has been shaped by centuries of transmission. Arabic travelers like Ibn Battuta observed the Mali court but understood what they saw through Islamic frameworks that may have misinterpreted or overlooked important features. Later ethnography describes social structures that may have changed significantly over the intervening centuries. Every claim in this document carries an implicit caveat about evidentiary limitations.

## The Mande Social Hierarchy

### The Three Estates

Mande society recognized three fundamental social categories, often described using the term *mara* (caste or estate). These were not castes in the Indian sense — the comparison is imperfect — but hereditary social groups defined by occupation, marriage rules, and spiritual status.

**The Horon (Freeborn/Nobles)** [P]

The *horon* (plural *horonw*) comprised the freeborn population — farmers, warriors, rulers, and merchants who were not attached to occupational specializations carrying spiritual danger. The term is often translated as "nobles," but this is somewhat misleading: the horon included both aristocratic lineages and ordinary farming families. What united them was freedom from the spiritual ambiguity of the nyamakala crafts and freedom from servile status.

Within the horon category, distinctions of rank were significant:
- **Royal lineages** (the Keita and allied families) occupied the apex of horon status
- **Warrior lineages** (like the Traore, who produced important military leaders) held high prestige
- **Farming lineages** formed the majority of the horon population
- **Merchant lineages** (particularly the Dyula/Wangara trading networks) occupied a somewhat ambiguous position — wealthy and influential but engaged in commerce rather than the warfare and farming idealized by horon culture

The horon were expected to embody *fadenya* (father-childness), the competitive, ambitious, individualistic ethic associated with the father's lineage, balanced with *badenya* (mother-childness), the cooperative, nurturing ethic associated with maternal connections. A proper horon man was brave in battle, generous with wealth, protective of dependents, and careful of his honor.

**The Nyamakala (Occupational Castes)** [P]

The *nyamakala* (also spelled *nyamakalaw*, *nyamakala*, *namakhala*) were occupational specialists whose work involved the manipulation of powerful spiritual forces. They included:

- **Numu** (blacksmiths): Workers of iron and wood, including sculptors and makers of ritual objects. The forge was a place of transformation where raw matter became tools and weapons; this transformative power was both essential and dangerous.

- **Jeli/Djeli** (griots, bards): Oral historians, musicians, praise-singers, and diplomats. The jeli possessed the power of speech — to praise or blame, to preserve or forget, to mediate or inflame.

- **Garanke** (leatherworkers): Crafters of leather goods including shoes, bags, saddles, and amulets. Their work with animal skins carried its own spiritual associations.

- **Fina/Finaw**: In some Mande communities, a category associated with Islamic learning and sometimes identified as descendants of early Muslim converts.

The nyamakala were not "outcasts" in the sense of being despised or marginal. They were essential to Mande society and could accumulate considerable wealth and influence. The great griots who served the Keita court wielded political power through their monopoly on historical memory and their ability to shame or praise powerful men. Blacksmiths were credited with mystical powers and consulted for divination and healing. But the nyamakala were also separated from the horon by strict endogamy rules: a horon could not marry a nyamakala without suffering severe social consequences.

**The Jon (Enslaved/Servile)** [P]

The *jon* (plural *jonw*) encompassed various categories of unfree and dependent persons. The term is typically translated as "slave," but this flattens a range of statuses from chattel slavery to forms of dependency closer to serfdom or clientage. Categories within jon status included:

- **Jon acquired through warfare** (war captives who might be sold, sacrificed, or integrated into households)
- **Jon acquired through debt** (persons who had pledged themselves or been pledged by family members to settle debts)
- **Jon born into servitude** (children of jon, whose status was generally inherited)
- **Jon of the royal household** (who might wield considerable power as trusted servants of the mansa)

The jon existed outside the normal structures of horon honor and shame. They could be bought and sold (at least in principle), their marriages were controlled by their masters, and their labor belonged to others. But within these constraints, individual jon could achieve positions of trust and even power, as the remarkable career of [[HF-Sakura|Sakura]] demonstrates.

### Nyama: The Spiritual Dimension

The concept of *nyama* is essential to understanding why Mande social categories were not merely economic but spiritual. [T/D]

Nyama is typically translated as "life force," "spiritual energy," or "occult power." It pervades the universe and can be concentrated in persons, objects, and actions. Certain activities — working iron at the forge, hunting dangerous animals, speaking words of power — concentrate nyama in ways that can be dangerous to oneself and others.

The nyamakala were defined by their relationship to nyama. The numu blacksmith worked at the forge where metal was transformed by fire; this act of transformation concentrated nyama in the smith and his products. The jeli wielded the power of speech, which in Mande thought was not merely communicative but performative — words created realities, and the jeli's praise or blame had material consequences for their subjects' honor and fate. These powers made the nyamakala both essential and dangerous.

The horon avoided direct manipulation of nyama through craft work precisely because such manipulation was spiritually contaminating. A horon who took up blacksmithing would lose horon status — not because smithing was "low" work, but because it involved spiritual dangers that compromised horon purity. The horon-nyamakala distinction was thus a division of spiritual labor: the nyamakala handled dangerous forces so that the horon did not have to.

**Scholarly Debate:** The antiquity of the nyama concept and its relationship to the caste system is debated. Some scholars argue that nyama beliefs are ancient and that the caste system developed around them. Others suggest that the caste system may have developed for economic reasons and was subsequently justified through nyama ideology. Still others note that "nyama" as a unifying concept may be a later systematization of diverse local beliefs. [D]

### Caste Endogamy and Social Boundaries

Marriage rules enforced the boundaries between social categories. [P]

- **Horon could only marry horon.** A horon who married a nyamakala would forfeit horon status for themselves and their children.
- **Nyamakala generally married within their specific group.** Blacksmiths married blacksmiths; griots married griots. Some intermarriage occurred between nyamakala groups, but these were the exceptions.
- **Jon could marry only with their masters' permission.** Children of jon unions were generally jon themselves, though manumission created pathways out of servile status.

These endogamy rules were not absolute in practice. The Arabic sources hint at flexibility in actual marriage practices, and the oral tradition includes examples of transgressive unions. But the ideology of separate marriage pools was strong and is repeatedly emphasized in the ethnographic literature.

The consequence of these rules was that social categories were largely hereditary. One was born horon, nyamakala, or jon, and remained so for life (with the exception of manumission from jon status). Social mobility between categories was extremely limited, though mobility within categories — a horon lineage rising to prominence, a jon achieving the mansa's trust — was possible and even celebrated in the oral tradition.

## Lineage and Clan (Jamuw)

### Patrilineal Descent

Mande society was organized around patrilineal descent: one belonged to one's father's lineage (*fa*), inherited from one's father's line, and identified primarily with one's father's clan. [P]

The basic unit of social organization was the *lu* (household), consisting of a senior man, his wives, his unmarried children, and often his married sons with their families. Multiple lu claiming descent from a common ancestor formed a *kabila* (extended family or lineage), and multiple kabila sharing a clan name (*jamu*) formed a larger identity group.

The *jamu* (clan name, also *jamuw* for the system) was fundamental to Mande identity. Every Mande person carried a clan name — Keita, Traore, Diarra, Konate, Coulibaly, Camara, and dozens of others — that identified their patrilineal ancestry and their place in the social system. Clan names indicated:

- **Social category:** Certain names were associated with horon status, others with nyamakala groups, others with jon origins (though this last category was often obscured)
- **Historical associations:** Clan names carried memories of ancestral deeds, alliances, and enmities
- **Joking relationships:** Specific clans had *sanankuya* (joking cousin) relationships with other clans, allowing ritualized mockery and obligating mutual hospitality

### Clan Names and Identities

The major clans of the Mali Empire included:

**Royal and Aristocratic Clans (Horon)**
- **Keita:** The royal clan descended from Sundiata; held the mansaya (kingship)
- **Konate:** Closely allied to the Keita; sometimes considered the same clan under a different name
- **Traore:** Military aristocracy; produced generals like Tiramaghan who expanded the empire
- **Camara/Kamara:** Warrior lineage associated with hunting traditions
- **Diarra:** Prominent aristocratic lineage
- **Conde:** The clan of Sundiata's mother, Sogolon

**Nyamakala Clans**
- **Kouyate:** The preeminent griot clan; Bala Faseke, Sundiata's griot, was a Kouyate
- **Diabate/Jawara:** Griot lineages
- **Kante:** Blacksmith lineage; Sumanguru, Sundiata's enemy, was a Kante (the connection between his blacksmith origin and his sorcerous power is central to the epic)

**Merchant Clans**
- **Ture/Toure:** Associated with the Dyula trading networks
- **Cisse:** Sometimes associated with Islamic learning and trade

These associations were not absolute. The same clan name could be found among different social categories in different regions, and clan identities evolved over time. But in the Mali heartland, clan names carried strong associations that shaped how individuals were perceived and treated.

### Joking Relationships (Sanankuya)

One of the most distinctive features of Mande social organization was the *sanankuya* (also *senankuya*) system of joking relationships between clans. [P/T]

Certain clans were designated as "joking cousins" (*sanankun*). Members of these clans could — and were expected to — mock, insult, and tease each other in ways that would be deeply offensive between other parties. A Keita and a Coulibaly, for example, could exchange elaborate insults that would be fought over if spoken between members of non-joking clans.

But sanankuya also imposed obligations:
- **Hospitality:** A sanankun could claim food, lodging, and assistance from their joking cousin; refusal was a serious breach
- **Mediation:** Sanankuya relationships could be invoked to defuse conflicts; a sanankun could intervene in disputes with ritual impunity
- **Alliance:** The joking relationship implied a bond of alliance beneath the surface mockery

The Kouroukan Fouga, the foundational charter attributed to Sundiata, is said to have established or ratified the sanankuya relationships between clans. Whether this represents a historical founding moment or a retrospective attribution of ancient custom to the empire's founder cannot be determined from the available evidence. [T]

The social function of sanankuya was significant: it created cross-cutting ties that bound Mande society together across clan and lineage divisions. The person who mocked you at a public gathering might also be the person obligated to shelter you if you arrived at their village in need.

### Marriage Alliances

Marriage in Mande society was not merely a union between individuals but an alliance between lineages. [P]

The ideal marriage was virilocal (the wife moved to her husband's household) and polygynous (men could have multiple wives if they could support them). Bridewealth (*nafulu*) was paid by the groom's family to the bride's family, representing not the "purchase" of the bride but compensation to her lineage for losing her labor and children.

Marriage strategies created alliances between lineages:
- **Repeated intermarriage** between the same lineages over generations created strong ties
- **Marriage to royal or aristocratic lineages** elevated a family's status
- **Marriage alliances** could resolve conflicts or cement political arrangements

The prohibition on horon-nyamakala marriage limited these alliance strategies. Horon lineages built networks with other horon lineages; nyamakala married within their communities. The jon married at their masters' discretion, and their unions did not create the same alliance bonds.

### Inheritance Patterns

Inheritance in Mande society followed patrilineal principles with some variations. [P/S]

**Property inheritance** passed from father to son, or in the absence of sons, to brothers or other male relatives. The senior son typically inherited the position of household head, but property was often divided among sons. Women could hold property but generally inherited less than their brothers.

**Office inheritance** — particularly the kingship — followed more complex rules. The mansa position did not pass strictly from father to eldest son. Brothers of a deceased mansa had strong claims, as did sons of previous mansas. This collateral succession pattern meant that power often rotated among different branches of the Keita lineage, creating both flexibility and conflict.

**Nyamakala inheritance** included not only property but occupational identity and the specialized knowledge that went with it. A griot's son was a griot; a blacksmith's son was a blacksmith. The craft knowledge, musical repertoires, historical narratives, and spiritual techniques were passed down within families.

---

## The Royal Clan (Keita)

### Origins and Legitimation

The Keita dynasty's claim to rule rested on the achievement of Sundiata, the founder who united the Mande clans and defeated the Sosso empire. [E/T]

According to the oral tradition, the Keita traced their descent from Bilali Bounama, identified with Bilal ibn Rabah, the Ethiopian companion of the Prophet Muhammad. This genealogical claim — which appears in Islamized versions of the tradition — linked the Keita to the very origins of Islam and gave them religious legitimacy in the eyes of Muslim observers. [T]

Whether this genealogy reflects historical reality, a later Islamic overlay on an indigenous lineage, or a deliberate construction to legitimate Keita rule in Islamic terms cannot be determined. What is clear is that by the fourteenth century, when Arabic writers recorded their information about Mali, the Keita's Islamic credentials were an important part of their public image.

The Keita legitimacy also rested on the Kouroukan Fouga, the foundational charter attributed to Sundiata. This charter established the social order of Mande society and designated the Keita as its rightful rulers. Whether the Kouroukan Fouga represents a real constitutional moment or a retrospective attribution is debated, but its ideological power is undeniable. [T/D]

### Succession Principles

Keita succession was neither strictly patrilineal (father to son) nor strictly collateral (brother to brother), but a combination that allowed for flexibility and competition. [P]

The evidence from Arabic sources and oral tradition suggests the following patterns:
- **Sons of a mansa had claims to succeed** — but not necessarily the eldest son
- **Brothers of a mansa had claims** — often succeeding before sons
- **The principle of capability** — a weak or incompetent candidate might be passed over for a more capable relative
- **Palace politics** — the support of court factions, including royal women and powerful officials, influenced succession

This system produced a certain stability (capable rulers could emerge from various branches of the family) but also chronic conflict (multiple candidates with plausible claims created rivalry). The usurpation of [[HF-Sakura|Sakura]], a non-Keita who seized the throne during a period of Keita weakness, demonstrates the limits of dynastic legitimacy when the actual Keita candidates were perceived as inadequate.

### Royal Women

Women of the Keita lineage held significant power, though the sources provide limited information about their roles. [P/S]

**Queen mothers** (*mansa muso ba*) appear to have held influence, though their formal powers are not clearly documented. The Sundiata epic emphasizes the importance of mothers — Sogolon's suffering and determination are central to the narrative — suggesting that maternal identity mattered in Mande political culture.

Ibn Battuta's account of the Mali court under Mansa Sulayman (1352-53) includes observations about royal women that, while filtered through his disapproving Islamic lens, suggest their visibility and influence:

> "The king's wives and his concubines go into the audience hall in the presence of the sultan, without any veil on their faces, and the daughters of the king also." [E]

Ibn Battuta found this shocking — women appearing unveiled before men was contrary to his understanding of Islamic propriety — but his disapproval reveals the fact itself: royal women participated publicly in court life.

**Marriage alliances** involving Keita women would have been politically significant, though specific examples are poorly documented. Royal daughters married to provincial governors or allied chiefs would have cemented political relationships.

### Court Organization

The Keita court at Niani (or wherever the capital was located) was a complex institution combining governance, ritual, and display. [P]

Ibn Battuta provides the most detailed eyewitness description of court procedures:

> "On feast-days... the sultan comes out in the afternoon. He takes his seat on a raised platform (*pempi*) covered with silk, over which is placed a canopy of silk with a great golden bird at the top... The sultan is preceded by musicians carrying gold and silver two-stringed guitars... Behind them come three hundred armed slaves. The sultan advances slowly, with much dignity, and takes his seat on the *pempi*... His head is covered with a golden bonnet (*qulansiyya*)... His costume is a red tunic (*ghilala*) of European cloth... Around his neck is a golden collar..." [E]

This description reveals a court organized for display and hierarchy. The sultan's elevation (on the pempi), his separation (behind a canopy), his adornment (gold bonnet, collar), and his musical heralds all marked him as set apart from ordinary humanity.

Court officials included:
- **Interpreters/spokesmen** who addressed the court on the mansa's behalf (the mansa did not speak directly to petitioners)
- **Griots** who maintained the praise songs and historical narratives
- **Commanders** of the military forces
- **Governors** of provinces who appeared at court or sent representatives
- **Religious officials** including Muslim scholars and perhaps practitioners of indigenous religion

The court was also a site of education and socialization for young aristocrats. Sons of provincial rulers and allied chiefs would be brought to court as hostages and students, learning court culture while ensuring their fathers' loyalty.

## The Griot Tradition

### Jeli as Historians, Musicians, and Diplomats

The *jeli* (plural *jeliw*; also *djeli*, *griot* in French) occupied a unique position in Mande society: simultaneously essential and ambiguous, powerful and subordinate. [E]

The jeli were professional specialists in speech — oral historians who preserved the genealogies and deeds of noble families, musicians who performed at ceremonies and celebrations, praise-singers who proclaimed the virtues of their patrons, and diplomats who conducted negotiations between parties. Their art was the art of the spoken word, and in Mande thought, the spoken word was not merely descriptive but creative.

**As historians**, the jeli preserved the collective memory of Mande society. The genealogies of noble families, the narratives of founding events like the Battle of Kirina, the praise-names and deeds of ancestors — all these were maintained by jeli lineages who specialized in the history of particular clans. The Kouyate jeli, for example, were especially associated with the Keita royal family, and it was a Kouyate griot (Djeli Mamadou Kouyate) whose version D.T. Niane recorded as *Sundiata: An Epic of Old Mali*.

**As musicians**, the jeli mastered instruments including the *kora* (21-string harp-lute), the *balafon* (wooden xylophone), the *ngoni* (lute), and various drums. Musical performance was not separate from historical narrative — the great epics were sung, not merely spoken — and instrumental skill was as important as verbal eloquence.

**As praise-singers**, the jeli had the power to build or destroy reputations. A jeli's praise elevated their patron, proclaiming their generosity, bravery, and noble descent. But the absence of praise — or, worse, a jeli's mockery — could shame a person before the community. This gave jeli considerable leverage over even the most powerful horon.

**As diplomats**, the jeli carried messages between parties, negotiated disputes, and arranged marriages and alliances. Their role as intermediaries was protected by convention — one did not attack a jeli messenger — and their verbal skills were deployed in the delicate work of negotiation.

### Griot-Patron Relationships

The jeli-horon relationship was one of mutual dependency and tension. [P]

**The patron's perspective:**
- The horon needed the jeli to proclaim their achievements and genealogy
- Jeli praise legitimated the horon's status and honored their ancestors
- But jeli could also threaten and shame: an ungenerous patron risked mockery
- The horon paid the jeli in money, cloth, food, and other gifts

**The jeli's perspective:**
- The jeli depended on horon patronage for livelihood
- Attachment to a powerful patron brought prestige and material reward
- But the jeli also possessed power over the patron through the manipulation of praise and blame
- The jeli's role required maintaining relationships with multiple patrons without offending any

This relationship could be described as clientage (the jeli as dependent on the horon) or as a form of power (the jeli as manipulating the horon through speech). Both descriptions capture part of the reality.

The most famous jeli-patron relationship in Mande tradition is that between Sundiata and Bala Faseke (also called Balla Fasseke). According to the epic, Bala Faseke was Sundiata's designated griot from childhood, assigned to him by his father. When Sumanguru captured Bala Faseke and tried to appropriate him, this was both a political injury (taking a valued servant) and a spiritual one (attempting to steal Sundiata's voice and memory). Bala Faseke's reunion with Sundiata is a moment of restoration in the narrative. [T]

### Inheritance of Griot Status

Jeli status was hereditary, passed from parent to child. [P]

**Occupational inheritance** meant that a jeli's children were expected to become jeli themselves. The skills — musical technique, historical knowledge, verbal artistry — were taught within families over years of training. This created lineages of specialists who accumulated expertise over generations.

**Marriage** occurred primarily within the jeli community. A jeli could marry another jeli, preserving the lineage's occupational identity. Cross-caste marriage (jeli marrying horon) would compromise the social position of both parties.

**Attachment to patron lineages** could also be inherited. The Kouyate jeli were historically associated with the Keita royal family; other jeli lineages had their own patron attachments. These relationships could persist over generations, with a jeli family serving the same horon lineage for centuries.

### Nyamakala Power and Danger

The jeli's power derived from their relationship to *nyama* — the spiritual force that animated the universe. [T/D]

Speech, in Mande thought, was not merely communicative but performative. The spoken word had power to create realities, to honor or shame, to bless or curse. The jeli, as masters of speech, wielded this power professionally. Their words affected the world.

This power made the jeli both essential and dangerous. Essential, because the horon needed the jeli's words to establish and maintain their honor. Dangerous, because the power that could build reputation could also destroy it. The jeli occupied a position of spiritual ambiguity — neither fully pure (like the horon ideal) nor fully contaminated (like the forge's transformative fire), but somewhere between.

The prohibition on horon-jeli marriage reflected this ambiguity. The horon maintained their purity by avoiding intimate connection with those who wielded nyama professionally. The jeli's power was necessary but also, in some sense, threatening.

## Slavery in Mali

### Categories of Unfreedom

The term *jon* encompassed multiple categories of unfree status that should not be collapsed into a single "slavery." [P]

**War captives** (*jon* in the strictest sense) were persons captured in warfare and reduced to chattel status. They could be:
- Sold in the trans-Saharan slave trade (Mali was a major supplier of enslaved persons to North Africa and the Mediterranean)
- Retained as household slaves in Mali
- Sacrificed in certain ritual contexts (though the Arabic sources suggest this practice was declining or disappearing under Islamic influence)
- Settled on agricultural land to produce for their captors

**Debt bondage** (*jon* through indebtedness) involved persons who had pledged themselves or been pledged by family members to settle debts. This status was theoretically temporary — the debt could be paid off — but in practice often became permanent.

**Hereditary servitude** (*wolosso* or "born in the house") comprised the descendants of enslaved persons. Those born into slavery within a household often had a different status than recently captured slaves: they were part of the household, knew no other life, and might be treated more like junior family members than like property.

**Royal slaves** occupied a distinct category. Enslaved persons attached to the mansa's household could wield considerable power as trusted agents of the ruler. Their servile status, paradoxically, made them useful: they had no lineage interests of their own and depended entirely on the mansa's favor.

### Domestic Slaves vs. Trade Slaves

A fundamental distinction existed between slaves retained within Mande society and those exported through the trans-Saharan trade. [P]

**Domestic slaves** were integrated into households, performed agricultural labor, craft work, and domestic service, and often developed long-term relationships with their masters. Over generations, the descendants of such slaves might be absorbed into Mande society, though their origin was remembered and their social position remained subordinate.

**Trade slaves** were commodities destined for export. The trans-Saharan slave trade supplied North African and Mediterranean markets with labor, domestic servants, soldiers, and concubines. These enslaved persons were removed from Mande society entirely, their fate determined by distant markets.

The Arabic sources indicate that Mali's rulers distinguished between these categories. Al-Umari reports that certain slaves were reserved for the ruler's household while others were designated for trade. The internal logic of the system preserved some enslaved persons for domestic use while treating others as export commodities.

### Paths to Slavery

Persons entered jon status through several mechanisms: [P]

**Warfare** was the primary source. The Mali Empire's military campaigns produced captives who could be enslaved. The expansion of the empire under Sundiata, Mansa Musa, and other rulers generated flows of captives that supplied both domestic slavery and the export trade.

**Debt** could reduce free persons to servitude. A person unable to pay their debts, or a family head pledging a dependent to settle obligations, could create debt-bondage relationships that sometimes became permanent.

**Birth** to enslaved parents generally produced enslaved children. The children of female slaves were slaves regardless of the father's status (though children of male slaves and free women might have ambiguous status).

**Criminal punishment** could result in enslavement in some cases. Certain offenses — though our sources are vague on specifics — could lead to the offender's reduction to servile status.

**Famine or disaster** could drive people to sell themselves or family members into slavery to survive. In times of hardship, enslaving oneself to a powerful patron might be a survival strategy.

### Manumission and Mobility

Enslaved persons could, in principle, be freed. [P]

**Manumission** (*furudiya*) released a slave from bondage. This could occur:
- As a pious act by a Muslim master (Islamic law encouraged manumission as meritorious)
- As a reward for loyal service
- Through purchase of one's freedom
- Upon the master's death (some masters freed slaves in their wills)

Freed slaves (*mawla* in Arabic terminology) retained a relationship with their former masters' lineages. They might be clients, dependents, or allies of the lineage that had owned them. Their origin was not forgotten, and full integration into horon status was not automatic — but they were no longer property.

**Social mobility within slavery** was possible in certain circumstances. The career of [[HF-Sakura|Sakura]] — a slave or freedman who became mansa of Mali — demonstrates the outer limit of what was possible. Sakura's case was extraordinary, but it reveals that servile origin did not absolutely preclude political achievement. More commonly, trusted slaves in royal households could accumulate influence and even wealth without ever achieving formal freedom.

### Royal Slaves as Administrators

The mansa employed enslaved persons in administrative capacities. [P/S]

This practice — using slaves as agents of royal power — was common across the medieval Islamic world and appears to have been adopted in Mali. Enslaved administrators had advantages from the ruler's perspective:
- They had no lineage interests that might conflict with royal policy
- They depended entirely on the mansa's favor for their position
- They could be controlled more directly than free nobles
- They could be used against local interests without the complications of kinship politics

The practice was not without risks. Slave administrators could accumulate power, and if the ruler weakened, they might seek to make their power permanent. Sakura's usurpation may represent exactly this pattern: a slave close to power taking power for himself when the legitimate dynasty faltered.

## Gender Roles

### Women's Economic Roles

Women in Mali participated actively in economic life, though within constraints defined by the patrilineal system. [P/S]

**Agriculture** divided labor by gender. Men typically cleared land and performed heavy work; women planted, weeded, and processed crops. Women controlled certain crops (vegetables, condiments) and the income from selling them.

**Trade** involved women at local levels. Market trade, particularly in foodstuffs and craft goods, included female sellers. Whether women participated in long-distance trade is less clear; the Dyula merchant networks appear to have been male-dominated.

**Craft production** by women included pottery, weaving (in some contexts), and food processing. These activities were not part of the nyamakala system but were ordinary household production.

**Household management** gave senior women considerable authority within domestic spaces. The senior wife in a polygynous household managed the other wives and the household's internal economy.

### Royal Women and Queen Mothers

Women of the royal lineage held political significance. [P/S]

**Queen mothers** appear in the oral tradition as powerful figures. Sogolon, Sundiata's mother, is central to the epic — her suffering, her prophecy, her role in her son's eventual triumph. This narrative emphasis suggests that maternal identity mattered in political culture, even if we cannot reconstruct specific institutional roles.

**Mansa's wives** appeared at court, as Ibn Battuta's scandalized observation confirms. Their visibility suggests a public role, though its precise nature is unclear. Senior wives may have influenced succession politics and served as advisors.

**Marriage alliances** involving royal women would have been diplomatically significant, creating connections between the Keita and other lineages.

### Marriage and Polygyny

Marriage in Mali followed Mande patterns modified by Islamic influence. [P]

**Polygyny** — men having multiple wives — was practiced among those who could afford it. The mansa had multiple wives; wealthy nobles and merchants had multiple wives; ordinary men might have one or two. Islamic law permitted up to four wives; Mande practice may have been more flexible before Islamization.

**Bridewealth** was paid by the groom's family to the bride's family. This payment established the marriage alliance and compensated the bride's lineage for her departure.

**Residence** was typically virilocal: the wife moved to her husband's household. She retained connections to her natal family but became part of her husband's lineage for purposes of residence and her children's identity.

**Divorce** was possible, though the conditions and consequences are not clearly documented for the medieval period.

### Ibn Battuta's Observations

Ibn Battuta's account of Mali (1352-53) includes observations about gender relations that, while colored by his Islamic disapproval, provide rare eyewitness detail. [E]

On women's visibility at court:
> "The women there have 'ichika' [friends] and 'dukana' [companions] amongst the men, and the men in the same way have 'ichika' amongst the women."

Ibn Battuta was shocked by what he perceived as inappropriate intimacy between unrelated men and women. His disapproval reveals that Mande gender norms differed from North African Islamic expectations — women had male friends, and this was socially acceptable.

On women's attire:
> "The women's condition — their nakedness and exposure of their private parts... I used to see many of them in this state... I used to marvel at them."

This observation must be treated carefully. Ibn Battuta's standards of "nakedness" were those of North African Islam, where female covering was the norm. What he saw as "naked" women may have been women in ordinary Mande attire that simply differed from his expectations.

On women's agency:
> "I saw that the women there are of surpassing beauty, and they are shown more respect than the men."

This statement is striking. Ibn Battuta's assessment that women were shown "more respect than the men" suggests that he perceived a level of female status that he considered inappropriate. Whether this reflects Mande reality or his misinterpretation of what he saw is impossible to determine.

## Age and Generation

### Elder Authority

Age was a fundamental organizing principle in Mande society, with elders (*faama*) commanding respect and authority. [P/S]

The senior man in a household exercised authority over the household's members — wives, children, junior kin, and dependents. His decisions on matters of property, marriage, and labor allocation were binding, though he was expected to consult with other adult men and to respect custom.

At the lineage level, senior men met to resolve disputes, make decisions, and manage collective resources. Age brought presumptive wisdom, and the oldest active men held positions of honor.

Elder women also held authority within female spheres. The senior wife in a polygynous household managed the other wives; older women controlled certain kinds of knowledge (regarding childbirth, healing, food preparation) that younger women sought to learn.

### Initiation Societies

Mande societies organized age cohorts through initiation. [T/S]

Young men of similar age went through initiation together, creating lifelong bonds. The initiation process — which included seclusion, instruction in secret knowledge, and sometimes circumcision — transformed boys into men. Initiates emerged as a cohort (*ton*) with special solidarity.

Some initiation societies (*ton* or *dyo*) continued to function throughout life, organizing collective labor, maintaining order, and performing rituals. These societies cut across lineage divisions, creating another layer of cross-cutting ties that bound communities together.

The specific form and content of initiation varied by region and period. The extent to which the initiation societies documented in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries represent continuity with medieval practices is uncertain.

## Urban vs. Rural Society

### Court Society

The mansa's court was its own social world, with distinct norms and relationships. [P]

**The capital** (probably Niani during much of the imperial period) housed the royal household, government officials, military commanders, griots and other court specialists, foreign merchants and diplomats, and the various dependents and servants who made the court function. This was an urban environment, though "urban" by medieval Sahelian standards rather than by Mediterranean or Chinese ones.

Court culture emphasized:
- **Hierarchy and protocol:** Elaborate rituals of greeting, seating, and address marked status distinctions
- **Display:** Gold, fine cloth, horses, and slaves demonstrated wealth and power
- **Patronage:** Access to the mansa and his favor determined political success
- **Islamic learning:** The court patronized Muslim scholars and maintained Islamic observances

Those who succeeded at court needed skills different from those required in village life: the ability to navigate complex hierarchies, to please powerful patrons, to interpret signs and rumors, to display generosity without appearing weak.

### Merchant Communities

The trading towns of Mali — Timbuktu, Djenne, Gao, Walata — developed their own social patterns. [P]

**Merchant lineages** (particularly the Dyula/Wangara networks) dominated long-distance trade. These lineages were often Muslim, used Islamic commercial law, and maintained connections across vast distances. Their Islam was not merely personal piety but a commercial asset: shared religious identity facilitated trust in long-distance transactions.

**Foreign merchants** — North African Muslims, possibly Jews, later Europeans — resided in trading towns and formed distinct communities. In the "twin city" pattern described by al-Bakri for Ghana and possibly applicable to Mali's cities, foreign merchants lived in quarters separate from the indigenous population.

**Craft specialists** in trading towns included artisans serving commercial needs: metalworkers, leatherworkers, weavers, and others. Their relationship to the nyamakala categories of the countryside may have been complex.

### Agricultural Villages

The majority of Mali's population lived in agricultural villages, growing millet, sorghum, rice (in favorable areas), and other crops. [S]

Village society was organized around:
- **Lineages:** Farming households related by patrilineal descent
- **Age grades:** Cohorts of men who worked together, especially in collective labor
- **Village leaders:** Typically drawn from the lineage that founded the village or that held local authority
- **Religious specialists:** Including practitioners of indigenous religion and, in some areas, Muslim clerics

The relationship between villages and the imperial state varied. Some villages paid tribute; some supplied soldiers; some were largely autonomous, recognizing the mansa's authority only nominally. The empire's reach was uneven, stronger near the capital and trade routes, weaker in peripheral areas.

### Pastoral Groups

Pastoral peoples — Fulani (Fulbe) and others — interacted with Mali's sedentary population. [P/S]

The Fulani were cattle-herders who moved seasonally with their herds, trading milk and meat for grain and other goods. Their relationship with farming communities was typically symbiotic: cattle grazed on harvested fields (fertilizing them), and pastoralists exchanged animal products for agricultural goods.

The Fulani's political relationship to Mali is less clear. Some Fulani groups may have been tributary; others maintained independence. The Fulani would later become major political actors in the region (the Fulani jihads of the 18th-19th centuries), but during Mali's height, they appear as economic partners rather than political players.

## Islam and Social Structure

### Islam's Arrival and Spread

Islam came to the Mande world through the trans-Saharan trade networks, carried by North African merchants and scholars. [E]

The process was gradual. Merchant communities in trading towns adopted Islam first, finding it commercially advantageous to share religious identity with their North African partners. Royal courts adopted Islamic elements, employing Muslim scribes and clerics and performing Islamic rituals. The general population Islamized more slowly, retaining indigenous practices alongside or beneath Islamic observance.

By Mansa Musa's time (r. 1312-1337), Islam was firmly established at the Mali court. Musa's famous hajj demonstrated his Islamic credentials to the wider Muslim world. But even in Musa's era, Islam coexisted with indigenous religion at court and in the countryside.

### How Islam Affected (or Did Not Affect) Social Categories

Islam's relationship to Mande social structure was complex. [D]

**What Islam challenged:**
- **Hereditary distinctions** were contrary to Islamic egalitarianism, which held that all believers were equal before God. In principle, a slave who became Muslim was spiritually equal to a king who became Muslim.
- **Certain nyamakala practices** — particularly those involving what Muslims considered sorcery or idolatry — were suspect from an Islamic perspective.
- **Elements of indigenous religion** — offerings to spirits, certain forms of divination — were incompatible with Islamic monotheism.

**What Islam did not change:**
- The **caste system persisted** through the Islamization process. The horon-nyamakala distinction survived, and griots continued to function as they had before. Islam was layered onto existing social structures rather than replacing them.
- **Slavery continued and expanded.** Islamic law regulated slavery (permitting enslavement of non-Muslims, prohibiting enslavement of Muslims, encouraging manumission) but did not abolish it. The trans-Saharan slave trade, which exported enslaved Africans to North Africa and the Mediterranean, was conducted within an Islamic framework.
- **Patrilineal kinship and clan organization** continued. Islam modified some marriage and inheritance rules but did not transform the basic kinship system.

**What Islam added:**
- A **new category of religious specialists** — Muslim scholars, clerics, and teachers — who were sometimes integrated into the nyamakala system (as the "fina" or similar groups) and sometimes stood outside it.
- **Islamic literacy** — the ability to read and write Arabic — which created new possibilities for record-keeping, correspondence, and scholarship.
- **Connections to the wider Islamic world** — pilgrimage, trade, scholarly exchange — that linked Mali to a civilization spanning from Spain to Indonesia.

### Syncretism and Coexistence

The relationship between Islam and indigenous religion was not simply one replacing the other but a complex coexistence and blending. [P]

**At court:** Rulers like Mansa Musa were devout Muslims who built mosques and went on hajj. But even at court, indigenous practices persisted. Ibn Battuta observed rituals that he considered un-Islamic — poets reciting in bird masks, dustings with powder at royal audiences — that suggest the survival of indigenous ceremonial elements.

**Among the nyamakala:** The griots, blacksmiths, and other specialists continued their traditional practices, which were not easily compatible with strict Islamic observance. Some became Muslims while continuing their traditional work; others maintained more distance from Islamic practice.

**In the countryside:** The general population's adoption of Islam was partial and syncretic. Indigenous religious practices — offerings to spirits, the use of amulets, consultation of diviners — continued alongside Islamic prayer and fasting. "Islam" and "traditional religion" were not mutually exclusive categories for most people.

## For Fiction Writing

### Griot Performances

**Setting the scene:**
A griot performance was both entertainment and ritual, a moment when history came alive through music and recitation. The setting might be:
- The mansa's court, with the griot performing before assembled nobles, the sultan on his raised platform, gold and silk catching the light
- A noble's compound, where a griot has been summoned to celebrate a birth, marriage, or military victory
- A public square during a festival, with crowds gathered to hear the epic narratives
- A quiet evening, with a master griot teaching his craft to a young apprentice

**Sounds:**
- The kora's cascading notes, like water over stones
- The balafon's wooden resonance, each struck bar producing a different tone
- The griot's voice — sometimes singing, sometimes speaking, sometimes chanting in a style between the two
- The audience's responses: ululations of approval, shouted praise names, rhythmic clapping

**What the griot says:**
Griot speech is not ordinary conversation. It includes:
- **Praise names:** "Simbon!" (Master hunter) "Son of the Buffalo Woman!" "He who makes the thunder jealous!"
- **Genealogies:** "Sundiata, son of Maghan Kon Fatta, son of..." — the recitation of ancestors
- **Narrative episodes:** The great deeds of the ancestor being praised, told in vivid language
- **Proverbs and wisdom:** "A cutting word is worse than a bowstring; a bowstring can only wound, but a cutting word can kill"
- **Direct addresses:** Praising the patron, teasing joking cousins, invoking the spirits of the ancestors

**The griot's power:**
A griot could make a noble beam with pride or squirm with discomfort. Generous patrons received lavish praise; stingy ones might find their ancestors' embarrassing moments suddenly remembered. The threat was never explicit — a good griot was too skilled for that — but everyone understood the stakes.

### Caste Interactions

**Horon and nyamakala:**
The relationship was intimate and hierarchical, necessary and constrained. A scene might include:
- A noble summoning his griot to prepare a message for a rival — the griot will not merely carry words but shape them for maximum effect
- A blacksmith presenting a newly forged sword to a warrior — the transaction involves not just metal but the nyama invested in the weapon
- A leatherworker crafting amulets for a family, binding protective power into the leather
- The awkwardness when a young horon develops feelings for a nyamakala — a relationship that cannot be sanctioned

**Among equals:**
- Horon meeting horon: the elaborate courtesies, the competitive hospitality, the displays of generosity
- Nyamakala meeting nyamakala: griots comparing repertoires, blacksmiths discussing techniques, the shop talk of specialists
- The sanankuya relationships: joking cousins mocking each other in ways that would start fights between others

**Across the divide:**
- A horon entering a blacksmith's forge: the slight discomfort, the awareness of entering a space charged with nyama
- A griot in a noble household: both servant and power figure, feeding the family's honor while depending on their patronage
- The moment when a horon must ask a nyamakala for something only they can provide — the negotiation of hierarchy and dependency

### Court Life

**Audience with the mansa:**
- The approach through outer courtyards, past guards and gatekeepers
- The announcement by heralds and griots: "Praise to the mansa! The lord of the gold! The son of Sundiata!"
- The petitioner's prostration, rubbing dust on their head as a sign of submission
- The mansa elevated on his pempi, separated by the canopy, speaking through intermediaries
- The elaborate protocol: who may approach, who may speak, who must remain at a distance

**Daily rhythms:**
- Morning prayers in the mosque attached to the palace
- Audiences in the mid-morning, before the heat becomes unbearable
- Rest during the hottest hours
- Evening gatherings, with music and conversation
- The mansa's movements tracked by courtiers hoping for favor

**Political maneuvering:**
- Factions supporting different candidates for future succession
- Provincial governors seeking influence at court
- Merchants seeking trading privileges
- Foreign diplomats negotiating treaties
- The constant competition for the mansa's attention and favor

### Village Scenes

**Agricultural rhythms:**
- The dry season: clearing fields, preparing for planting, the hunger months when last year's grain runs low
- The first rains: planting, the relief when the crops sprout
- The growing season: weeding, watching for pests, prayers for sufficient rain
- Harvest: communal labor, celebration, the granaries filled
- The markets: women selling vegetables, men selling livestock, traveling merchants with exotic goods

**Social gatherings:**
- Age-grade meetings: young men planning their collective labor, older men settling disputes
- Women's circles: sharing work, exchanging news, teaching skills
- Evening stories: elders telling tales by firelight
- Ceremonies: initiations, weddings, funerals, seasonal festivals

**Village leadership:**
- The village chief (*dugutigi*) presiding over disputes
- The council of elders deliberating
- The shrine keeper performing rituals
- The occasional visit from an imperial representative collecting tribute

### Slavery Portrayal

**The complexity:**
Slavery in Mali was not the Atlantic plantation slavery that shapes most modern understanding. Portraying it requires nuance:
- The war captive, recently enslaved, terrified and disoriented
- The domestic slave, born in the household, effectively part of the family (but still property)
- The royal slave, wielding power over free men while remaining technically unfree
- The slave destined for export, a commodity about to be transported across the Sahara

**The humanity:**
Enslaved persons were not merely categories. A fiction might explore:
- A skilled craftsman who happens to be enslaved, respected for his abilities while constrained by his status
- A woman enslaved through her father's debt, remembering her free childhood
- A slave soldier, fiercer in battle because he has nothing to lose
- A manumitted slave, technically free but still bound by ties of clientage and memory

**The economics:**
Slavery was woven into Mali's economy:
- Agricultural slaves working the fields of wealthy men
- Domestic slaves managing households
- The slave trade route across the Sahara, human beings as commodities
- The prices: a healthy male slave might be worth the same as several cattle or a certain weight of gold

### Sensory Details

**The built environment:**
- Mud-brick walls, smoothed by hand, golden-brown in the sunlight
- Thatched roofs, conical or flat depending on region
- Woven mats on earthen floors
- Carved wooden doors, geometric patterns
- The mosque's tower, its mud surface studded with projecting wooden beams

**Climate:**
- The dry season heat: shimmering air, dust that coats everything, the desperate search for shade
- The rains: sudden downpours, the smell of wet earth, the explosion of green
- The harmattan: fine Saharan dust that turns the sky hazy, the cool dry wind
- The cool season nights: stars blazing in clear air, fires welcome for warmth

**Sounds:**
- The balafon's wooden resonance, the kora's rippling cascade
- Griots singing praise songs, the rhythmic responses of the audience
- Cattle lowing at evening, goats bleating, chickens scratching
- The call to prayer from the mosque
- Women pounding grain in wooden mortars, the rhythmic thump
- Children's games, laughter, the occasional wail of an infant

**Tastes:**
- Millet porridge (*to*), thick and slightly sour, eaten with sauces
- Grilled meat at festivals, the charred flavor, the fat dripping
- Baobab fruit, sour and refreshing
- Kola nuts, bitter and stimulating, shared as gifts
- Shea butter, rich and slightly nutty, used in cooking and on skin

**Smells:**
- Wood smoke, constant, from cooking fires
- Shea butter, its distinctive richness
- The forge, hot metal and charcoal
- The tannery, the sharp smell of hides being processed
- Incense at ceremonies, masking less pleasant smells

## Scholarly Debates

### Antiquity of the Caste System

**The question:** When did the horon-nyamakala distinction emerge? Was it present in Sundiata's time, or is it a later development that the oral tradition projects backward?

**Position A:** The caste system is ancient, predating the Mali Empire and possibly rooted in distinctions between farmer and specialist populations in the first millennium CE.

**Position B:** The caste system developed during the Mali imperial period (13th-15th centuries) and was subsequently portrayed as primordial through oral tradition.

**Position C:** The caste system as documented in the 19th-20th centuries has been significantly elaborated over time, and projecting it back to the medieval period is methodologically problematic.

**Current status:** [D] Debated. Most scholars accept that some form of occupational specialization and endogamy existed in medieval Mali, but the precise nature and rigidity of the system cannot be determined from available sources.

### Social Mobility

**The question:** How rigid was the social hierarchy? Could individuals move between categories?

**Position A:** The system was essentially rigid. One was born into a category and remained there for life.

**Position B:** The system allowed more flexibility than the ideology suggested. Examples like Sakura show that even the most dramatic boundary (free/slave) could be crossed.

**Current status:** [D] The ideology emphasized rigidity, but practice appears to have been somewhat more flexible, especially during periods of political disruption.

### Sources for the Pre-Contact Period

**The question:** How much of what we "know" about medieval Mali social structure actually reflects medieval reality, as opposed to later developments attributed retrospectively to the founding period?

**The challenge:** Our sources are:
- Arabic travelers who observed the court but may have misunderstood what they saw
- Oral tradition recorded in the 20th century, centuries after the events it describes
- Ethnography of 19th-20th century Mande societies, projected backward

**Current status:** [D] Fundamental uncertainty. Responsible scholarship uses these sources while acknowledging their limitations and marking confidence levels carefully.

### The Kouroukan Fouga

**The question:** Was there a historical foundational assembly at which Sundiata promulgated a charter for Mande society?

**Position A:** The Kouroukan Fouga reflects a real historical event, a constitutional moment at which the social order was established or ratified.

**Position B:** The Kouroukan Fouga is a retrospective attribution, a way of giving ancient authority to customs that developed over time.

**Position C:** There may have been some foundational event, but the specific content of the charter as recorded in modern times has been significantly elaborated.

**Current status:** [T] The tradition itself is well documented; its historical accuracy is uncertain. UNESCO inscribed the Manden Charter on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2009, recognizing its cultural significance regardless of precise historical status.

## Sources

### Primary Sources

**Sundiata Epic (Oral Tradition)**

The primary source for Mande social ideology, including the caste system, clan relationships, and nyama concepts. Key versions:

- **D.T. Niane, *Sundiata: An Epic of Old Mali*** (1960; English trans. 1965): The most widely read version, based on griot Djeli Mamadou Kouyate's narration. Beautiful literary prose but smooths over variations between versions.

- **David C. Conrad, *Sunjata: A West African Epic of the Mande Peoples*** (2004): More scholarly edition with multiple versions and extensive notes, better for academic purposes.

**Reliability note:** The epic is invaluable for understanding how Mande society understood itself. Its historical accuracy for specific facts (dates, events) is uncertain; its accuracy for social ideology is high but reflects the ideology of its transmission context, which has changed over centuries. [T]

**Ibn Battuta, *Rihla*** (c. 1354)

Moroccan traveler who visited Mali in 1352-53 under Mansa Sulayman. Provides the only detailed eyewitness account of the Mali court by someone who understood Islamic culture and could compare Mali to other Muslim societies.

**Key content for social structure:** Court protocol, gender relations, the coexistence of Islamic and indigenous practices, the role of griots at court.

**Reliability note:** Ibn Battuta's observations are filtered through his Islamic expectations. His disapproval of certain practices reveals cultural differences but may lead him to mischaracterize what he saw. [E for eyewitness observations; use critically]

**al-Umari, *Masalik al-Absar*** (c. 1337-1349)

Egyptian scholar who interviewed witnesses to Mansa Musa's 1324 hajj. Provides information about Mali's wealth, administration, and ruling ideology.

**Key content for social structure:** Royal display, gold distribution, Mali's administrative organization.

**Reliability note:** Near-contemporary, based on eyewitness interviews, careful scholarship. [E]

**Ibn Khaldun, *Kitab al-'Ibar*** (c. 1377)

Tunisian historian who interviewed West African scholars and merchants, including Keita family members. Provides dynastic history and analytical framework.

**Key content for social structure:** Succession patterns, dynastic history, the Sakura interregnum.

**Reliability note:** The greatest medieval Arab historian; analytical and careful. [E]

### Secondary Sources

**Levtzion, Nehemia, *Ancient Ghana and Mali*** (1973)

The definitive scholarly study of the Ghana and Mali empires. Meticulous use of Arabic sources, essential for political history and chronology.

**Conrad, David C., various works**

Leading scholar of Mande oral tradition. Essential for understanding the Sundiata epic and its transmission.

**Gomez, Michael A., *African Dominion: A New History of Empire in Early and Medieval West Africa*** (2018)

The most recent major synthesis. Centers African perspectives and provides fresh analysis of Mali's political culture, including social organization.

**Tamari, Tal, "The Development of Caste Systems in West Africa"** (*Journal of African History*, 1991)

Important scholarly article examining the origins and development of the caste system across West Africa.

**McNaughton, Patrick R., *The Mande Blacksmiths: Knowledge, Power, and Art in West Africa*** (1988)

Anthropological study of the numu blacksmiths, with extensive discussion of nyama and the spiritual dimensions of craft work.

**Hoffman, Barbara G., *Griots at War: Conflict, Conciliation, and Caste in Mande*** (2000)

Anthropological study of the jeli tradition, with attention to historical dimensions.

### Source Assessment

The evidence for Mali's social structure is rich but problematic:

**Strengths:**
- The oral tradition provides detailed information about social ideology
- Arabic travelers offer near-contemporary observations
- The persistence of the caste system into modern times allows ethnographic supplementation

**Weaknesses:**
- The oral tradition was recorded centuries after the medieval period and has been shaped by its transmission context
- Arabic travelers observed the court, not ordinary life, and filtered what they saw through Islamic expectations
- Projecting modern ethnography back to the medieval period is methodologically uncertain

Every claim in this document carries implicit uncertainty. Where possible, confidence levels are marked. Where they are not marked, assume [P] Probable or [D] Debated.
