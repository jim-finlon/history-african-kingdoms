## Overview

Slavery and unfree labor existed throughout Sub-Saharan Africa in the centuries before the Atlantic slave trade, but these institutions differed fundamentally from the chattel slavery that would devastate the continent after 1500. To understand pre-Atlantic African slavery is to confront a spectrum of dependency relationships — from household servants who might eventually be absorbed into kinship networks to brutally exploited laborers in salt mines — rather than a single, monolithic institution. The challenge for scholars is to describe these varied forms of unfreedom accurately without either minimizing the suffering they caused or anachronistically applying Atlantic-era categories to earlier periods.

African societies generated enslaved persons through multiple mechanisms: warfare and raiding, judicial punishment, debt default, self-sale during famine, and hereditary transmission of enslaved status. The majority of enslaved persons remained within Africa, absorbed into households, agricultural enterprises, military forces, and state administrations. A significant minority, however, were exported: northward across the Sahara to the Mediterranean world and Islamic lands, and eastward across the Indian Ocean to Arabia, Persia, India, and beyond. These external trades were substantial — together probably moving hundreds of thousands of people over the centuries of our period — but they operated within African political and economic systems where African rulers and merchants controlled the supply.

Any discussion of pre-Atlantic African slavery must acknowledge the historiographic minefield surrounding this topic. Colonial-era European writers seized upon the existence of African slavery to justify the Atlantic trade ("Africans enslaved each other anyway") while simultaneously claiming that African slavery was uniquely cruel (thus positioning Europeans as civilizers). Modern scholarship has worked to dismantle both claims, demonstrating that pre-Atlantic African slavery, while real and often harsh, operated according to different logics than Atlantic chattel slavery, and that the Atlantic trade represented a catastrophic rupture rather than a continuation of existing practices. The following analysis attempts to present the evidence fairly, acknowledging African agency in the slave trade while refusing to use that agency to exculpate later European systems, and centering the experiences of enslaved people themselves wherever the fragmentary sources allow.

## Terminological Precision

### The Translation Problem

One of the most significant challenges in studying African slavery is terminological. When Arabic sources use the word *'abd* (slave), when Mande speakers use *jon*, when Portuguese observers use *escravos*, are they describing the same thing? The answer is usually no — or at least, not exactly.

**Arabic terminology:** [P]
- *'Abd* (pl. *'abid*): The broadest Arabic term for slave, but carrying connotations from Islamic law that may not match African realities
- *Khadim* (pl. *khuddaam*): Servant, often with implications of higher status than *'abd*
- *Jariya* (pl. *jawari*): Female slave, often with sexual/concubinage implications
- *Ghulam* (pl. *ghilman*): Male slave, often with military implications
- *Mamluk*: Slave soldier, owned but paradoxically often holding power
- *Mawla* (pl. *mawali*): Freed slave or client; ambiguous status between slave and free

Arabic writers applied their own categories to African institutions, potentially distorting the picture. When al-Bakri or Ibn Battuta describe "slaves" in Ghana or Mali, they filter African realities through Islamic legal and social concepts.

**African terminology (selected):** [P]
- *Jon* (Mande): Person in servile status; encompasses multiple grades of dependency
- *Jongo* (Mande): Category of slave, possibly with specific labor implications
- *Woloso* (Mande): "House-born" slave — born into slavery rather than captured; typically better status
- *Ohu* (Igbo): Slave, but with complex local meanings
- *Oru* (Igbo): Another term for unfree persons
- *Barya* (Ethiopian/Amharic): Slave, but the institution differed from Arabic *'abd*
- Various Bantu terms: *mtumwa* (Swahili), etc.

**European terminology:** [P]
Portuguese observers used *escravos* (slaves) freely, but their frame of reference was Iberian chattel slavery and the emerging Atlantic system. They may have mistranslated or misunderstood African social relationships that did not match Iberian categories.

### The Spectrum of Unfreedom

Rather than a binary slave/free distinction, most African societies featured a spectrum of dependency and freedom: [P]

```
More Free ←————————————————————————————→ Less Free

Full free status → Clients/dependents → Debt bondage → Pawns →
Household slaves → Agricultural slaves → Mine/labor camp slaves →
War captives (recent) → Export to trans-Saharan/Indian Ocean markets
```

Movement along this spectrum was possible in both directions. Captives could be absorbed into households and eventually into kinship networks; the children and grandchildren of slaves might become full members of society. Conversely, free persons could fall into dependency through debt, misfortune, or crime.

### Distinction from Atlantic Chattel Slavery

Pre-Atlantic African slavery differed from the Atlantic system in several crucial ways: [P]

| Aspect | Pre-Atlantic African Slavery | Atlantic Chattel Slavery |
|--------|------------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Legal personhood** | Enslaved persons often retained some legal personhood; could own property, testify, participate in religion | Enslaved persons legally property; no recognized personhood |
| **Racial ideology** | Not based on race; enslaved and enslavers were the same populations | Explicitly racial; developed ideology of Black inferiority to justify system |
| **Generational persistence** | Status often ameliorated over generations; children/grandchildren could assimilate | Status hereditary and permanent; children born into slavery remained enslaved |
| **Kinship absorption** | Enslaved persons could be incorporated into kinship structures | Kinship claims systematically denied; families deliberately separated |
| **Manumission** | Relatively common; encouraged by Islam; multiple paths to freedom | Rare; legally restricted; discouraged |
| **Labor regime** | Variable; often domestic; plantation-style agriculture uncommon | Industrial agricultural production; systematic exploitation maximizing output |
| **Scale** | Significant but proportionate to population | Unprecedented scale; 12+ million transported |
| **Mortality** | Variable; often not significantly higher than general population | Extreme mortality rates in Middle Passage, plantations, and aftermath |

This comparison should not be read as minimizing pre-Atlantic African slavery. The salt mines of Taghaza, where enslaved laborers worked and died in extreme conditions, were hellish by any standard. Captured warriors might be executed or condemned to brutal labor. Women faced sexual exploitation. Children were separated from families. But the systematic, racialized, industrial-scale horror of Atlantic slavery was something new in human history.

## Categories of Unfreedom

### War Captives

**The most common source of enslaved persons throughout the period was warfare.** [E]

When African states fought — and they fought frequently — the victors took captives. These captives became enslaved persons, either retained by their captors or sold into trade networks. War captivity was the primary mechanism generating both domestic slavery and export trades.

**Ibn Battuta** (1352-53) describes seeing slaves in the Mali Empire: [E]
> "The Mansa had with him 300 male slaves bearing arms..."

**Al-Bakri** (c. 1068) describes Ghana's military campaigns: [P]
> The king "makes war against those who do not pay the tribute..."

The logic was circular: states made war to acquire captives, and captives funded further war-making (whether as soldiers or as trade goods exchanged for horses and weapons). This dynamic intensified over time as trans-Saharan and Indian Ocean demand for slaves grew.

**Status of recent captives:** [P]
- Least secure status on the spectrum of unfreedom
- Could be sold, gifted, executed, or sacrificed
- Often performed the harshest labor
- Linguistic and cultural barriers isolated them from surrounding society
- Over time, successful integration might improve their position

### Debt Bondage

**Debt was the second major source of unfreedom.** [P]

Across African societies, individuals who could not repay debts might become bound to their creditors. This bondage could take several forms:

**Pawning:** [P]
A debtor might place a family member (often a child or young person) with a creditor as security for a debt. The pawn's labor served as interest on the debt. In theory, pawns were not slaves — they retained their family connections and were to be returned upon debt repayment. In practice, debts might never be repaid, and pawns might slide into permanent enslavement.

**Self-sale:** [P]
During famines or disasters, individuals might sell themselves or family members into slavery to survive. This represents the desperation of people with no other options, not a "voluntary" choice in any meaningful sense. The Arabic sources occasionally mention this practice in West Africa, particularly during drought years.

**Debt slavery:** [P]
Unpaid debts could transform into permanent enslavement, particularly if the debtor died before repayment. Heirs might inherit the debt and its associated bondage.

### Judicial Enslavement

**Courts could sentence offenders to slavery as punishment for crimes.** [P]

Offenses that might result in enslavement included:
- Murder (if victim's family accepted enslavement of the perpetrator rather than execution or blood payment)
- Theft and property crimes
- Adultery and sexual offenses
- Sorcery or witchcraft accusations
- Political crimes (rebellion, treason)

Judicial enslavement served multiple functions: it punished the offender, compensated victims, removed dangerous individuals from society, and generated laborers or trade goods for the state. Critics of African slavery sometimes point to judicial enslavement as evidence of systemic abuse of legal systems to generate slaves for export, and there is evidence that some rulers expanded the categories of enslaveable offenses as export demand increased. [D]

### Birth into Slavery (Hereditary Enslavement)

**Children of enslaved mothers typically inherited enslaved status, though with important variations.** [P]

**Matrilineal transmission:** [P]
The principle "the child follows the mother's status" was widespread but not universal. If an enslaved woman bore children, those children were enslaved. This created a self-reproducing enslaved population.

**Variations by father's status:** [P]
- Children of two enslaved parents: enslaved status relatively clear
- Children of enslaved mother and free father: highly variable; in some societies, father's acknowledgment could confer free status; in others, children remained enslaved
- Children of free mother and enslaved father: typically free (following maternal descent)

**Generation-based amelioration:** [P]
In many African societies, the status of "house-born" slaves (*woloso* in Mande) was significantly better than that of recent captives. Third- or fourth-generation descendants of slaves might be virtually indistinguishable from free persons, especially if the family had intermarried with free lineages. This contrasts sharply with Atlantic slavery, where the "one-drop rule" and racial ideology prevented such assimilation.

### Voluntary Servitude (Famine, Protection, Clientship)

**Not all entries into servitude were forced.** [P]

**Famine refugees:** [S]
During famines, individuals and families might seek attachment to wealthy households, exchanging their labor and freedom for food and protection. The line between "voluntary servitude" and "coerced by starvation" is ethically problematic — these were survival decisions, not free choices.

**Protection seekers:** [S]
Individuals fleeing blood feuds, legal judgments, or enemies might attach themselves to powerful patrons as dependents. The patron offered protection; the dependent offered service and loyalty. This resembled European serfdom or Roman clientship more than chattel slavery.

**Religious dedication:** [S]
Some traditions involved dedication of individuals to religious institutions or deities. The status of these religious dependents varied — some were essentially enslaved, others held privileged positions.

---

## Domestic Slavery

### Household Incorporation

**The majority of enslaved persons in pre-Atlantic Africa were incorporated into households rather than confined to labor camps or plantations.** [P]

This does not mean their position was comfortable. Household slavery still meant:
- Forced labor
- Subordinate status
- Potential sexual exploitation (especially for women)
- Separation from natal family and community
- Dependence on the goodwill of enslavers

But it also meant:
- Integration into a social unit
- Potential for relationship-building with enslavers
- Access to the household's resources (food, shelter, protection)
- Opportunities for skilled work and advancement
- Possible eventual absorption into kinship networks

**Ibn Battuta's observations of Mali:** [E]
Ibn Battuta describes enslaved persons serving in domestic capacities — cooks, attendants, porters, messengers. These individuals had day-to-day proximity to their enslavers, which could lead either to better treatment (recognition as individuals) or to abuse (constant availability).

### Kinship-like Relationships

**The most distinctive feature of African domestic slavery was the potential for enslaved persons to be incorporated into kinship structures.** [P]

In many African societies, kinship was not solely biological but could be created through various mechanisms:
- Adoption
- Marriage
- Ritual incorporation
- Long-term residence and service

Enslaved persons who remained in a household for extended periods, especially those who were house-born, might gradually acquire kinship-like status. Their children might marry into free families. Their grandchildren might be considered full members of the lineage.

This assimilative potential was strongest when:
- The enslaved person was culturally similar to the enslavers (same language, religion)
- The enslaved person demonstrated loyalty and competence
- The enslaved person had children with free partners (especially if acknowledged by free fathers)
- The household was small enough for personal relationships to develop

It was weakest when:
- The enslaved person was culturally foreign (different language, religion, ethnicity)
- Large numbers of enslaved persons reduced individual attention
- Labor demands were intense and impersonal (mining, large-scale agriculture)
- The enslaved person was destined for export

### Labor Obligations

**Enslaved persons in domestic settings performed a wide range of tasks:** [P]

**Women's work:**
- Food preparation and cooking
- Childcare and nursing
- Textile production (spinning, weaving, dyeing)
- Water and firewood collection
- Agricultural labor (planting, harvesting)
- Market trading (sometimes with significant autonomy)
- Sexual and reproductive labor (concubinage)

**Men's work:**
- Agricultural labor
- Herding and animal husbandry
- Craft production (blacksmithing, leatherwork, carpentry)
- Construction
- Porterage and transport
- Military service (especially in state systems)
- Messenger and administrative duties

### Gradual Assimilation Across Generations

**The generational trajectory of enslaved families often moved toward freedom, though not inevitably.** [P]

**First generation (captured):**
- Outsider status; linguistic/cultural barriers
- Lowest status; most vulnerable to sale, harsh treatment
- Primary identity as "slave"

**Second generation (house-born):**
- Born into enslaver's culture and language
- Higher status than captives (*woloso* vs. *jon*)
- May have kinship ties through free fathers
- Still enslaved but with improved position

**Third+ generation:**
- May be virtually indistinguishable from free persons
- May intermarry with free lineages
- Origin may become "forgotten" or no longer socially relevant
- In some societies, formal manumission unnecessary — status simply evolves

**Obstacles to assimilation:**
- Enslavers who maintained strict separation
- Large-scale slaveholding where individual relationships impossible
- Ongoing demand for slave labor preventing release
- Stigma attached to slave ancestry (sometimes persisting for generations)
- Export to foreign markets eliminating assimilation opportunity

---

## Slavery in State Systems

### Royal Slaves as Administrators

**Major African states employed enslaved persons in administrative positions, creating a paradox: slaves who wielded real power.** [P]

**The logic of slave administration:**
Rulers faced a constant problem: how to staff a bureaucracy with competent officials who would remain loyal. Free aristocrats had their own power bases, family ambitions, and potential claims to the throne. Enslaved administrators, by contrast:
- Owed their position entirely to the ruler
- Had no independent power base
- Could be dismissed, punished, or executed without aristocratic backlash
- Depended on the ruler's continued favor for their status
- Often came from foreign backgrounds, lacking local ties that might create conflicts of interest

**Mali Empire:** [P]
Arabic sources mention enslaved persons in administrative roles at the Mali court. The extent of slave bureaucracy is unclear, but the principle of using dependent persons for governance was established.

**Songhai Empire:** [P]
The Songhai bureaucracy included enslaved officials, though the highest positions were typically held by members of the ruling or aristocratic classes. The division between slave and free in administration was not absolute.

**Benin Kingdom:** [P]
The Oba of Benin employed palace slaves (*ikpakpa*) in administrative and ceremonial roles. These individuals served the Oba directly, managing aspects of palace life and sometimes acting as intermediaries with the wider kingdom.

### Military Slaves

**The use of enslaved persons as soldiers was widespread, though rarely as systematic as the Islamic *mamluk* institution.** [P]

**Arguments for slave soldiers:**
- Loyal to the ruler who armed them
- No competing clan or lineage obligations
- Could be trained from youth in military skills
- No independent power base to threaten the throne
- Depended entirely on the ruler for status

**West African examples:** [P]
- Mali and Songhai rulers maintained slave guards and soldiers
- Kanem-Bornu employed slave soldiers alongside free warriors
- The Hausa states developed significant slave military forces

**Limitations in Africa:** [D]
Unlike the Islamic heartlands, where the *mamluk* system became a major institution, African slave armies remained subordinate to free warrior elites in most cases. The reasons are debated:
- Different military technologies (cavalry vs. infantry emphasis)
- Different political structures (less centralized power)
- Different economic bases (less surplus to support standing armies)
- Different cultural values (warrior honor associated with free status)

### Palace Organization

**Royal palaces employed large numbers of enslaved persons in specialized roles:** [P]

**Roles in palace slavery:**
- Personal attendants to the ruler
- Cooks and food preparers
- Guards and security
- Entertainers (musicians, dancers)
- Craftspeople (smiths, weavers, carvers)
- Messengers and intermediaries
- Concubines and secondary wives
- Eunuchs (in some contexts, though less common in Sub-Saharan Africa than in the Middle East)

**The palace as a distinct zone:**
Palace slaves often occupied an ambiguous position — enslaved in legal status but wielding influence through proximity to power. A trusted palace slave might have more practical power than a free peasant or even a minor aristocrat.

### Sakura: The Slave Who Became Emperor

**The most dramatic example of slave mobility in medieval Africa was [[HF-Sakura|Sakura]], the freed slave who became Mansa (Emperor) of Mali (r. c. 1285-1300).** [P]

Ibn Khaldun describes Sakura as a *mawla* (freedman/client) of the Keita royal house who "seized the kingship" during a period of dynastic weakness. He ruled effectively, expanded Mali's territory, went on hajj to Mecca, and was murdered on the return journey in Tajura.

**What Sakura's story demonstrates:**
- Enslaved persons could rise to positions of power in African states
- The boundary between slave and free was permeable under certain circumstances
- Capability and ambition could overcome servile origins
- Dynastic legitimacy, while important, was not invulnerable to challenge

**What it does not demonstrate:**
- That slavery in Africa was "benign" or that most slaves had opportunities like Sakura's
- That social mobility for the enslaved was common (Sakura's case was extraordinary)
- That enslaved status was merely nominal (Sakura's origins remained a political liability)

## The Trans-Saharan Slave Trade

### Scale Estimates

**Estimating the volume of the trans-Saharan slave trade is extremely difficult; all figures are [Speculative].** [S]

**The methodological challenge:**
Unlike the Atlantic trade, the trans-Saharan trade generated no systematic records. We have:
- Occasional Arabic descriptions of caravans
- Scattered references to slave markets
- Archaeological evidence of trade routes
- Comparative analysis with later documented periods
- Estimates of receiving societies' demand

**Scholarly estimates (for the period 300-1600 CE):**
- Ralph Austen (leading quantitative scholar): approximately 4 million people exported across the Sahara between 650-1600 CE, averaging perhaps 4,000-7,000 per year at peak periods [S]
- Other scholars argue for higher or lower figures
- All estimates carry enormous uncertainty

**Comparison with Atlantic trade:**
The Atlantic slave trade (c. 1500-1900) transported approximately 12.5 million people — a scale that dwarfed the trans-Saharan trade. Even at its peak, the trans-Saharan trade moved a fraction of the Atlantic volume.

### Demographics: Women and Children

**The trans-Saharan trade had distinctive demographic characteristics that differed from the later Atlantic trade.** [P]

**Gender balance:**
- Trans-Saharan trade: majority female (estimated 60-70% women/girls)
- Atlantic trade: majority male (estimated 65% men/boys)

**Why the difference?**
The demand in receiving societies determined the demographic profile:
- North African and Middle Eastern demand: domestic servants, concubines, harem attendants — roles filled primarily by women
- Atlantic demand: plantation labor — roles preferring male workers for physical strength

**Children:**
Children made up a significant portion of trans-Saharan exports. Young children could be:
- More easily acculturated to receiving societies
- Trained for specific roles (domestic service, skilled trades)
- Less likely to resist or escape
- More valuable in concubinage markets (girls)

**Implications:**
The gender and age profile of the trans-Saharan trade meant:
- Receiving societies absorbed enslaved persons more readily (women through concubinage, children through household integration)
- Enslaved populations in receiving areas did not reproduce themselves at high rates
- The trade had to be continuously replenished with new captures
- African societies lost disproportionately in women of childbearing age

### Destinations

**Where did trans-Saharan slaves go?** [P]

**North Africa (Morocco, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt):**
- Domestic service in urban households
- Agricultural labor (less common than in Atlantic context)
- Military service (especially in Morocco)
- Harems and concubinage
- Craft production

**Egypt and the Mamluk Sultanate:**
- Military service (the Mamluk system recruited from multiple sources, including Africa)
- Domestic service
- Administration (some rose to high positions)

**Arabia and the wider Islamic world:**
- Similar patterns to North Africa
- The holy cities (Mecca, Medina) had significant enslaved populations

**Mediterranean Europe (limited):**
- Some trans-Saharan slaves reached Christian Europe through North African intermediaries
- Numbers small compared to intra-Islamic circulation

### African Agency in the Trade

**African rulers and merchants controlled the supply side of the trans-Saharan slave trade.** [E]

**Who captured and sold enslaved persons?**
- African states through warfare and raiding
- Independent raiders and kidnappers
- Judicial systems that sentenced offenders to enslavement
- Families in debt or crisis who sold members

**Who profited?**
- African rulers who taxed or monopolized the trade
- African merchants who transported and sold enslaved persons
- Intermediary traders (Wangara, Dyula, others)
- North African and Arab merchants (buyers)

**Power dynamics:**
Trans-Saharan merchants came to African markets; they did not raid interior Africa themselves. African rulers could refuse to sell, could negotiate prices, could favor some traders over others. This does not make African participation "innocent" — they profited from human trafficking — but it does mean they operated from positions of strength, not coercion.

**The moral question:**
Acknowledging African agency in the slave trade is historically accurate but ethically complex. African rulers who sold people into slavery were responsible for their choices. At the same time:
- The existence of African slavery does not justify the Atlantic trade
- African participation does not transfer moral responsibility from European slavers
- The scale and nature of Atlantic slavery was not a continuation but a rupture
- Colonial-era arguments using African slavery to excuse European crimes are historically and morally bankrupt

## The Indian Ocean Slave Trade

### East African Exports

**The Swahili Coast and the Horn of Africa exported enslaved persons eastward across the Indian Ocean.** [P]

**Sources of enslaved persons:**
- War captives from interior Africa
- Purchased from interior trading networks
- Judicial enslavement
- Debt bondage and pawning

**The trade network:**
Interior Africa → Swahili Coast ports (Kilwa, Mombasa, Mogadishu, Sofala) → Indian Ocean crossing → Arabia, Persian Gulf, India, (rarely) Southeast Asia and China

**Scale (highly speculative):** [S]
Estimates for the medieval Indian Ocean slave trade are even more uncertain than trans-Saharan figures. Perhaps 1,000-3,000 persons per year at peak periods, totaling perhaps 2-4 million over the centuries of our period. These numbers are extremely uncertain.

### The Zanj

**Arabic sources use "Zanj" to refer to the peoples of the East African coast and their enslaved members who reached Islamic lands.** [E]

**The Zanj Rebellion (869-883 CE):**
The most dramatic event associated with the Indian Ocean slave trade occurred just before our period: the Zanj Rebellion in southern Iraq. Enslaved Africans working in brutal conditions to reclaim salt marshes near Basra revolted, establishing an independent state that resisted the Abbasid Caliphate for fourteen years. The rebellion demonstrates:
- Large numbers of East African enslaved persons reached Iraq
- Conditions were harsh enough to provoke massive revolt
- Enslaved Africans were capable of sophisticated political and military organization
- The revolt's suppression did not end the Indian Ocean slave trade

**After the rebellion:**
The Zanj Rebellion made Islamic slave owners more cautious about concentrating large numbers of African slaves in agricultural or industrial labor. Post-rebellion, there was a shift toward domestic slavery, smaller holdings, and concubinage — patterns that characterized the Indian Ocean slave trade for the rest of our period.

### Destinations

**Where did Indian Ocean slaves go?** [P]

**Arabia:**
- Domestic service
- Pearling industry (especially the Persian Gulf)
- Date cultivation (limited)
- Military service (guards)
- Concubinage

**Persia:**
- Domestic service
- Military service
- Court attendants

**India:**
- Domestic service
- Military service (some African military slaves rose to prominence in Indian states)
- Concubinage

**Further east:**
- Small numbers of African slaves reached China and Southeast Asia
- Evidence sparse; numbers minimal

### Comparison with Trans-Saharan Trade

| Aspect | Trans-Saharan | Indian Ocean |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| **Volume** | Larger [S] | Smaller [S] |
| **Gender ratio** | Majority female | Majority female |
| **Primary destinations** | North Africa, Egypt, Arabia | Arabia, Persia, India |
| **Transport** | Overland caravan | Maritime (dhow) |
| **Journey mortality** | High (Saharan crossing) | Variable (sea voyage) |
| **African exporters** | Sahel empires, Saharan intermediaries | Swahili Coast city-states, interior suppliers |

## Regional Variations

### West Africa: Mali and Songhai Empires

**The great Sahel empires had complex slave systems combining domestic, administrative, military, and export functions.** [P]

**Domestic slavery:**
Households throughout Mali and Songhai employed enslaved persons for domestic labor, agriculture, and craft production. The distinction between free and slave was meaningful but permeable.

**State slavery:**
The Mali and Songhai emperors employed enslaved persons in:
- Royal households
- Military forces
- Administrative positions
- Agricultural estates

**Export trade:**
The Sahel empires sat astride the trans-Saharan routes and profited from the slave trade, though gold and salt remained the primary trade goods. Enslaved persons were one commodity among several.

**The Taghaza salt mines:** [E]
The salt mines at Taghaza in the central Sahara were worked by enslaved labor under conditions that Arabic sources describe as terrible:
> "Taghaza is a village with nothing good about it... There is no one there except the slaves of the Massufa who dig for the salt. They live on dates imported from Dra'a and Sijilmasa, camel meat, and millet..." (Ibn Battuta, 1352)

Taghaza represents the harshest end of the African slavery spectrum — industrial labor in extreme conditions with high mortality.

**The Sundiata epic and slavery:** [T]
The Mande oral tradition depicting Sundiata's rise includes enslaved characters. The epic reflects a society where slavery was unremarkable — part of the social landscape — but where individual enslaved persons could be portrayed sympathetically.

### Benin Kingdom

**The Benin Kingdom's slavery system was integrated with its complex political structure.** [P]

**Palace slavery:**
The Oba of Benin employed enslaved persons (*ikpakpa*) in the palace for:
- Domestic service
- Ritual functions
- Administrative support
- Craft production (including bronze-casting)
- Human sacrifice (for royal funerals and other occasions) [E]

**Human sacrifice:**
Benin Kingdom practiced human sacrifice, particularly at royal funerals when enslaved persons and war captives were killed to accompany the deceased Oba. Portuguese observers documented this practice:
> "When the King dies... they kill many slaves to serve him in the other world" (Portuguese accounts, late 15th century)

This aspect of Benin slavery represents its most brutal manifestation — humans as expendable ritual objects.

**Domestic slavery:**
Beyond the palace, Benin households employed enslaved persons in domestic and agricultural roles similar to other West African societies.

**Oral tradition on slavery in Benin:** [T]
Benin oral histories record wars of expansion that generated captives, some of whom became enslaved within Benin society, others of whom were sold to traders.

### Swahili Coast

**Swahili Coast slavery combined domestic service with agricultural production and maritime labor.** [P]

**Plantation slavery (limited):**
Some Swahili Coast areas developed agricultural slavery on a larger scale than typical for Africa, particularly for:
- Grain production (to feed urban populations and provision ships)
- Coconut and palm cultivation
- Possible sugar cultivation (debated)

The agricultural systems of the Swahili Coast approached (but did not match) the plantation model that would later characterize the Americas.

**Domestic slavery:**
Swahili urban households employed enslaved persons for:
- Domestic service
- Porterage and transport
- Craft production
- Fishing and maritime labor

**Export trade:**
Swahili merchants were intermediaries in the Indian Ocean slave trade, purchasing enslaved persons from interior suppliers and selling them to Arabian and other Indian Ocean traders.

**Integration and assimilation:**
Enslaved persons on the Swahili Coast could be assimilated into Swahili society over generations. Swahili identity itself was syncretic — combining Bantu African, Arab, and other elements — and this openness extended to incorporating formerly enslaved persons.

### Ethiopia: The Gabbar System

**Ethiopian slavery and servitude included distinctive local forms alongside patterns found elsewhere in Africa.** [P]

**Barya (slaves):**
Ethiopian society recognized enslaved persons (*barya*) who could be bought, sold, and inherited. Sources of enslavement included:
- War captives (especially from campaigns against lowland peoples)
- Purchase from southern regions
- Judicial enslavement
- Debt bondage
- Birth to enslaved mothers

**The gabbar system:**
The *gabbar* system was a form of servitude that attached peasants to the land and to lords. Gabbar were not slaves — they could not be bought or sold — but they owed labor and produce to their lords and were bound to the land in a manner resembling European serfdom. [P]

**Church and slavery:**
The Ethiopian Orthodox Church owned enslaved persons, employed them on church lands, and received them as donations. The church also encouraged manumission as a pious act, creating tension between institutional slaveholding and religious ideals.

**Royal slavery:**
Ethiopian emperors employed enslaved persons in:
- Court service
- Military forces
- Agricultural labor on royal lands
- Administrative roles

**Export trade:**
Ethiopia was both a source and a transit point for the slave trade. Enslaved persons moved:
- North through the Nile corridor to Egypt
- East through Red Sea ports to Arabia
- South (in exchange for goods from interior Africa)

### Zimbabwe Tradition

**The Zimbabwe Plateau civilizations (Great Zimbabwe, Mapungubwe, Mutapa) employed servile labor, though documentation is sparse.** [S]

**Archaeological evidence:**
Archaeological evidence from Great Zimbabwe and related sites does not clearly distinguish free from enslaved populations. The massive stone construction required substantial labor, but whether this was:
- Corvee labor (obligatory work by free subjects)
- Enslaved labor
- Voluntary labor for religious/political purposes

remains unclear.

**Oral tradition:** [T]
Shona oral traditions acknowledge the existence of slavery in precolonial society but provide limited detail for the period before Portuguese contact.

**Gold mining:**
Gold mining on the Zimbabwe Plateau — the source of exports that made Kilwa wealthy — likely employed some enslaved labor. Conditions in gold mining varied:
- Alluvial gold washing: relatively light labor
- Reef mining: more intensive and dangerous

**Portuguese observations:**
Portuguese accounts from the late 15th and 16th centuries describe slavery in the Mutapa state, but these observations postdate most of our period and may not accurately reflect earlier practices.

## Manumission and Mobility

### Paths to Freedom

**Multiple routes led from slavery to freedom in pre-Atlantic African societies.** [P]

**Owner's voluntary manumission:**
Owners could free enslaved persons through:
- Deathbed manumission (often religiously motivated)
- Gratitude for service
- Affection (especially for concubines and their children)
- Merit recognition

**Self-purchase:**
In some societies, enslaved persons could accumulate property and purchase their freedom. This required:
- Owner permission to engage in income-generating activities
- Sufficient time for accumulation
- Owner willingness to accept payment

**Religious manumission:**
Islam encouraged manumission as a pious act (expiation for sins, general merit). Muslim slaveholders in Africa, as elsewhere, freed enslaved persons for religious reasons. The effectiveness of this encouragement is debated — manumission was real but did not eliminate slavery.

**Generational assimilation:**
As discussed above, the children and grandchildren of enslaved persons often achieved freedom through gradual assimilation rather than formal manumission.

**Military service:**
Enslaved soldiers who demonstrated valor might be rewarded with freedom (and sometimes land, wives, or positions).

**Escape:**
Enslaved persons could attempt to flee. Success depended on:
- Distance from origin community
- Geography (easier to escape in forest than savanna)
- Receiving communities' policies (some harbored refugees; others returned them)
- Individual circumstances

### Children of Slave Mothers

**The status of children born to enslaved women was crucial to the slavery system's reproduction.** [P]

**If father was enslaved:**
Children inherited their mother's enslaved status without complication.

**If father was free but did not acknowledge:**
Children typically remained enslaved, following maternal status.

**If father was free and acknowledged (especially masters with concubines):**
Practice varied widely:
- In some societies, acknowledgment conferred free status
- In others, children remained enslaved but with elevated status
- Islamic law influenced many African societies: under Islamic jurisprudence, children of a free Muslim father and enslaved mother (*umm al-walad*) were free
- Local custom often modified or overrode Islamic principles

**Implications:**
The treatment of mixed-status children was a key variable in whether enslaved populations grew or shrank, and whether slavery was a permanent caste or a transitional status.

### Social Integration

**Freed persons and their descendants faced varying degrees of continued stigma.** [D]

**Evidence of full integration:**
- Sakura's rise to emperor suggests that slave origins could be overcome
- Oral traditions mention individuals of slave ancestry achieving prominence
- Ethnographic evidence (from later periods) shows integration over generations

**Evidence of persistent stigma:**
- Some societies maintained knowledge of slave ancestry for many generations
- Marriage restrictions between those of slave and free ancestry
- Occupational limitations
- Social prejudice

The balance between integration and stigma varied by society, time period, and individual circumstances.

## Gender and Slavery

### Women as Majority of Enslaved

**Across Sub-Saharan Africa, women constituted the majority of enslaved persons, both domestically and in export trades.** [P]

**Why women?**

**Reproductive value:**
Women's capacity to bear children added to their value. Children of enslaved women became enslaved, expanding the slaveholder's holdings. This was labor force reproduction.

**Domestic labor demand:**
Household tasks — cooking, cleaning, childcare, textile production, water and firewood collection — were women's work. Enslaved women performed these tasks for their owners.

**Sexual availability:**
Female slaves were sexually available to their male owners. This ranged from coerced rape to formal concubinage to occasional genuine affection. Women had little ability to refuse.

**Lower flight risk:**
Women, especially those with children, were less likely to attempt escape than men. They were considered more easily controlled.

**Export market demand:**
Trans-Saharan and Indian Ocean markets demanded women for domestic service and concubinage. African sellers responded to this demand.

### Concubinage

**The sexual exploitation of enslaved women through concubinage was widespread.** [E]

**What was concubinage?**
A formal or informal sexual relationship between a free man and an enslaved woman. The woman was not a wife but not merely a casual sexual partner either. Her status was intermediate.

**Rights of concubines:**
In Islamic societies (and areas influenced by Islamic law):
- The *umm al-walad* (mother of a child by her master) gained certain protections
- She could not be sold
- She was freed upon her master's death
- Her children by the master were free

In non-Islamic African societies:
- Concubine status varied widely
- Some concubines became virtual wives
- Others remained sexual servants with no special status

**The experience of concubines:**
From the woman's perspective, concubinage was coerced sex. Whatever legal protections or material benefits it might bring, it was not freely chosen. Women became concubines because they were enslaved and had no right to refuse.

### Domestic Labor

**Women performed the bulk of domestic labor, whether free or enslaved.** [P]

**Tasks:**
- Food preparation (time-consuming in pre-industrial societies)
- Childcare (including nursing children of mistresses)
- Textile production (spinning, weaving, dyeing)
- Water collection (often requiring long walks)
- Firewood collection
- Cleaning and household maintenance
- Market trading (in some societies)

**Conditions:**
Domestic labor conditions varied with the household. In a small, poor household, an enslaved woman might work alongside her mistress, eating the same food and living in similar conditions. In a wealthy household, she might work longer hours, face harsher discipline, and have less personal autonomy.

### Children's Status

**Children born to enslaved women were themselves enslaved, with rare exceptions.** [P]

**Mother-child separation:**
Young children generally stayed with their mothers. But older children might be:
- Sold separately from their mothers
- Given as gifts
- Transferred to other households
- Retained while the mother was sold

The evidence for African practices is sparse, but some separation clearly occurred. This was one of slavery's cruelties everywhere it existed.

**Childhood under slavery:**
Children of the enslaved were socialized into their status from birth. They learned their place, their obligations, and their limitations. Some might achieve better positions than their parents; others would not.

## Economic Role

### Agricultural Labor

**Enslaved persons worked in agriculture throughout Sub-Saharan Africa, though large-scale plantation slavery was uncommon before the Atlantic period.** [P]

**Small-scale agriculture:**
On small holdings, enslaved agricultural workers:
- Cleared land
- Planted and cultivated crops
- Harvested
- Processed crops (threshing, milling)
- Herded animals

Working conditions in small-scale agriculture were generally similar to those of free farmers, though without the products of their labor.

**Larger-scale production:**
Some areas developed more intensive agricultural slavery:
- Swahili Coast grain and coconut production
- Possible pre-Portuguese sugar cultivation
- Agricultural estates of major rulers

These approached but did not match Atlantic-era plantation scale.

### Mining: Gold and Salt

**Mining employed enslaved labor in some of the harshest conditions found anywhere in medieval Africa.** [E]

**Taghaza salt mines:**
As described above, enslaved workers at Taghaza labored in extreme conditions:
- Desert environment (extreme heat, minimal water)
- Underground mining (dangerous)
- Toxic salt dust
- Social isolation
- High mortality

This was industrial slavery at its worst.

**Gold mining:**
The gold fields of West Africa (Bambuk, Bure) and the Zimbabwe Plateau employed various labor regimes:
- Alluvial gold washing: relatively light work, often performed by women
- Reef mining: more intensive and dangerous
- Labor status: some free, some enslaved, some corvee (obligatory service)

Evidence for the specific conditions of gold mining labor is sparse.

### Craft Production

**Enslaved craft workers produced goods for their owners and for trade.** [P]

**Crafts employing enslaved labor:**
- Textile production (spinning, weaving, dyeing)
- Metalwork (some, though smithing had special status in many societies)
- Leatherwork
- Pottery
- Construction

**Skilled enslaved workers:**
Enslaved persons with craft skills were valuable. Their skills could lead to:
- Better treatment
- Greater autonomy
- Income-earning opportunities
- Eventual manumission

Some enslaved craftspeople achieved quasi-independent status, producing goods and paying a portion to their owners.

### Trade and Commerce

**Enslaved persons participated in trade, sometimes with significant autonomy.** [P]

**Market trading:**
Enslaved women in West African societies often traded in markets on their owners' behalf, or with permission to trade for their own benefit. This gave them:
- Access to cash or trade goods
- Social interactions outside the household
- Opportunities for self-purchase
- A degree of autonomy

**Long-distance trade:**
Some enslaved persons traveled with their merchant-owners on trading expeditions, handling goods, managing transactions, and sometimes achieving quasi-independent commercial status.

## African Perspectives: How Africans Understood and Justified Slavery

### Indigenous Moral Frameworks

**African societies had their own moral frameworks for understanding slavery — frameworks that did not simply accept it as "natural" but provided explanations and justifications.** [S]

**War as source of legitimacy:**
The most common justification: war captives belonged to their captors by right of conquest. Taking captives was part of the rewards of victory. The alternative — killing all prisoners — was often presented as worse.

**Crime as source of legitimacy:**
Judicial enslavement presented slavery as punishment. The enslaved person had committed a wrong and was paying for it through servitude. This framed slavery as justice rather than injustice.

**Debt as source of legitimacy:**
Debt bondage and pawning were explained as fair: debts must be paid; if money cannot pay, labor must.

**Outsider status:**
Many African societies distinguished sharply between insiders (kin, community) and outsiders (foreigners, enemies). Enslaving insiders was more problematic than enslaving outsiders, who lacked the protection of kinship and community.

### Islamic Influences

**Islam provided both justification for slavery and limitations on it.** [P]

**Justifications:**
- Enslavement of non-Muslims captured in legitimate warfare was permitted
- Slave ownership was legal and regulated
- Prophet Muhammad and his companions owned slaves

**Limitations:**
- Enslavement of fellow Muslims was prohibited
- Manumission was encouraged as pious
- Enslaved persons had certain rights (food, clothing, reasonable treatment)
- Sexual relations with enslaved women required specific conditions
- Beating and abuse were limited

**African application:**
In Islamized areas of Africa, these principles had real effects:
- Muslim captors could not enslave Muslim captives (theoretically)
- Manumission increased (somewhat)
- Some protective norms applied

But violations were common. Non-Muslim populations were repeatedly raided for slaves, and even Muslim populations were sometimes enslaved through legal fictions or simple disregard of rules.

### Silence and Normalization

**For most Africans, most of the time, slavery was simply part of the social landscape — not celebrated, not systematically questioned.** [S]

The oral traditions that survive do not contain systematic critiques of slavery as an institution. Enslaved individuals might be portrayed sympathetically; cruel owners might be condemned; the suffering of captives might be acknowledged. But the institution itself was taken for granted.

This silence does not mean Africans approved of slavery in some deep sense. It means:
- Slavery was ubiquitous (hard to imagine society without it)
- Power structures that benefited from slavery shaped discourse
- Those who might have criticized it (the enslaved) left few records
- Recorded traditions served elites who owned slaves

## Historiographic Note: Colonial-Era Distortions and the Need for African-Centered Analysis

### Colonial-Era Distortions

**European colonial writers distorted African slavery in multiple contradictory ways.** [E]

**Distortion 1: "Africans enslaved each other, so European slavery was acceptable"**
This argument attempted to shift moral responsibility from European slave traders to African slave sellers. It ignored:
- The scale difference (Atlantic trade was vastly larger)
- The nature difference (chattel slavery was fundamentally different)
- The agency question (Africans did not choose Atlantic slavery; they participated in a trade Europeans created demand for)
- The moral logic (one wrong does not justify another)

**Distortion 2: "African slavery was uniquely cruel, proving African barbarism"**
This contradictory claim presented African slavery as worse than European slavery to justify colonial "civilizing missions." It ignored:
- Evidence of assimilation and manumission in African systems
- The extreme brutality of Atlantic slavery
- The survivorship of African societies under indigenous slavery vs. their devastation under Atlantic slavery

**Distortion 3: "Africans had no civilization before Europeans arrived"**
This broader claim erased African history, including the complex social, political, and economic systems that incorporated slavery. It allowed Europeans to claim credit for whatever they found in Africa.

### Modern Scholarly Approaches

**Post-independence African historiography has worked to correct these distortions.** [E]

**Key principles:**
1. **African agency:** Africans were actors in their own history, including in slavery. This agency must be acknowledged without excuse-making.

2. **Specificity:** "African slavery" was not one thing. Regional, temporal, and contextual variation was enormous. Generalizations must be handled carefully.

3. **Comparison without hierarchy:** African slavery can be compared to slavery elsewhere (Islamic world, ancient Mediterranean, Americas) without assuming that one system was normative or "better."

4. **Centering the enslaved:** Where possible, historians should attempt to recover the experiences of enslaved people themselves, not just the perspectives of slaveholders.

5. **Avoiding both minimization and exaggeration:** African slavery was real, caused real suffering, and should not be minimized. But it should also not be exaggerated or used to excuse Atlantic slavery.

### The Ongoing Debate

**Scholarly debate continues on several questions:** [D]

- How "open" was African slavery? (Could enslaved persons really assimilate, and how often?)
- How did the slave trades affect African societies? (Demographic, political, economic impacts)
- Did the trans-Saharan and Indian Ocean trades "prepare" Africa for the Atlantic trade?
- What role did African moral frameworks play in the slave trades?
- How should modern historians balance acknowledgment of African slavery with resistance to colonial-era distortions?

These debates are ongoing and unlikely to be fully resolved given the limitations of available evidence.

## For Fiction Writing

### Portraying Enslaved Characters with Dignity

**Fiction Potential: SIGNIFICANT BUT SENSITIVE**

Writing about enslaved characters requires balancing historical accuracy with human dignity. Enslaved persons were not merely victims; they were people with agency, intelligence, relationships, hopes, and inner lives.

**Principles for fiction:**

**1. Full humanity:**
Enslaved characters should be as fully realized as free characters — with desires, fears, relationships, opinions, and agency within their constraints.

**2. Agency within constraint:**
Enslaved persons exercised choices within their limited circumstances. They resisted, accommodated, negotiated, formed relationships, protected loved ones, and pursued their own goals. Show these choices.

**3. Varied experiences:**
Not all enslaved persons had the same experience. A trusted household servant had different daily life than a Taghaza salt miner. A concubine had different concerns than an agricultural laborer. Show this variety.

**4. Avoid instrumentalization:**
Enslaved characters should not exist solely to suffer for free characters' character development, or to demonstrate the villainy of enslaver characters. They should have their own stories.

**5. Avoid minimization:**
Do not portray slavery as "not that bad" or as a happy arrangement. Whatever the variation in conditions, slavery was coerced labor, separation from natal communities, and deprivation of freedom.

**6. Avoid gratuitous suffering:**
Depicting the horrors of slavery can be important, but torture porn is not educational. Focus on the human experience, not just the violence.

### Varied Experiences Within Slavery

**Different positions on the slavery spectrum offer different story possibilities:**

**Recent captive:**
- Trauma of capture and separation
- Linguistic and cultural isolation
- Uncertainty about the future
- Memories of free life
- Desperation to escape or return

**Household servant (long-term):**
- Complex relationships with enslaving family
- Possible affection alongside resentment
- Knowledge of household secrets
- Navigating daily life within constraints
- Potential for gradual improvement of position

**Skilled craftsperson:**
- Pride in work
- Relative autonomy
- Economic agency (selling products)
- Potential path to freedom
- Knowledge and skills as power

**Concubine:**
- Sexual coercion as central experience
- Possible affection and/or manipulation
- Children's status as central concern
- Relationship with primary wife/wives
- Potential for significant influence or total powerlessness

**Military slave:**
- Paradox of armed servitude
- Potential for power and status
- Questions of loyalty
- Possibility of manumission through service
- Violence as daily life

**Mine worker:**
- Harsh conditions, high mortality
- Solidarity with fellow workers
- Minimal assimilation possibility
- Endurance as central challenge
- Little hope of improvement

### Agency Within Constraint

**Enslaved persons were not passive. They exercised agency in multiple ways:**

**Everyday resistance:**
- Working slowly
- Feigning illness
- "Losing" tools or materials
- Sabotage
- Theft

**Cultural preservation:**
- Maintaining language and traditions
- Passing stories to children
- Religious practice
- Music and performance

**Negotiation:**
- Bargaining for better conditions
- Exploiting competition between owners
- Building relationships with those who could help
- Using knowledge strategically

**Economic activity:**
- Accumulating property (where permitted)
- Trading on own account
- Building toward self-purchase

**Escape:**
- Flight to free communities
- Return to homeland (often impossible)
- Finding refuge with enemies of enslaver

**Violence:**
- Rebellion (rare but documented)
- Individual acts of violence
- Self-harm as resistance

### Sensory Details

**Sensory elements for portraying enslaved life:**

**Visual:**
- Mark of enslaved status (scarification, branding — varied by region)
- Clothing restrictions or requirements
- Physical proximity to enslavers
- Sleeping arrangements (floor, separate quarters, doorway)
- Visible labor (carrying, working)

**Auditory:**
- Commands in enslaver's language
- Silence expected from servants
- Gossip and whispers among enslaved community
- Music and song as expression
- Sounds of punishment (varied — could include beating, verbal abuse)

**Tactile:**
- Hard physical labor
- Tools of trade
- Sleeping surfaces
- Chains or restraints (varied — not universal)
- Physical contact with enslavers (serving, grooming, sexual)

**Taste/smell:**
- Quality of food (often inferior)
- Smells of work (cooking, animals, fields, mines)
- Bodies in close quarters
- Dust, sweat, labor

### Emotional Landscape

**The inner lives of enslaved persons:**

**Loss:**
- Separation from family
- Loss of homeland and community
- Loss of name (often renamed by enslavers)
- Loss of life plans and hopes

**Fear:**
- Violence and punishment
- Sale and separation
- Sexual assault
- Death

**Anger:**
- At enslavers
- At those who captured and sold them
- Sometimes at themselves or fate

**Adaptation:**
- Finding ways to survive
- Building new relationships
- Creating meaning within constraints
- Hoping for improvement

**Complex feelings toward enslavers:**
- Hatred and resentment alongside
- Possible affection or loyalty (complicated)
- Strategic accommodation
- Dependency (for survival)

**Community with other enslaved:**
- Solidarity and mutual support
- Competition for resources or favor
- Transmission of survival knowledge
- Shared cultural practices

### Scene Opportunities

**1. The capture:**
The moment of transition from free to enslaved. Violence, chaos, terror. Separation from family. The beginning of a new life.

**2. The market:**
Being sold. Examination by potential buyers. The humiliation of commodification. Uncertainty about what comes next.

**3. Arrival at new household:**
Learning the rules. Meeting other enslaved persons. First encounters with enslavers. Assessment of the situation.

**4. Daily labor:**
The rhythms of work. Interaction with free persons. Small victories and defeats. Building relationships.

**5. Punishment:**
Violence as discipline. Witnessing others' punishment. The psychology of fear and resentment.

**6. Small resistance:**
A moment of defiance — small or large. The decision to resist. Consequences.

**7. Relationship with another enslaved person:**
Love, friendship, solidarity. The vulnerability of such relationships to sale and separation.

**8. Sexual encounter (if handling concubinage):**
Must be handled with extreme care. The coerced nature must be clear, even if feelings are complicated.

**9. Negotiation:**
Bargaining for better conditions. Using knowledge or skills as leverage. Success or failure.

**10. Manumission:**
The moment of gaining freedom. The emotions — relief, joy, disorientation, lingering anger. What comes next?

| **Comparison with other slave systems** | African slavery significantly different from Atlantic chattel slavery | Distinctions overstated; slavery was exploitation everywhere | [D] Most scholars emphasize real differences while acknowledging exploitation in all systems |
| **Islamic influence on African slavery** | Islam ameliorated conditions; encouraged manumission | Islamic principles often ignored; trade continued regardless | [P] Both true — principles provided some protections; violations common |
| **African moral responsibility** | Africans who sold humans bear moral responsibility | Focus on African agency serves to excuse Europeans | [D] Most scholars acknowledge African responsibility while refusing to use it to excuse Atlantic trade |
