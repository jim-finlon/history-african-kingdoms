## Overview

The economic systems of sub-Saharan Africa between 300 and 1600 CE were remarkably sophisticated, encompassing multiple forms of currency, organized markets, credit networks, and professional merchant communities that operated across vast distances. Far from the colonial-era caricature of "primitive barter," African economies developed complex monetary instruments, standardized weights and measures, regulated market institutions, and commercial practices that facilitated trade spanning thousands of kilometers --- from the gold mines of the forest zone to the Mediterranean, from the Zimbabwe Plateau to the Persian Gulf and beyond.

The diversity of African currency systems reflected both regional specialization and remarkable ingenuity in creating stores of value and media of exchange suited to local conditions. Gold dust, weighed to precise standards using sophisticated balance systems, served high-value transactions in West Africa. Salt --- scarce and physiologically essential in the tropics --- functioned as currency across the Sahel. Cowrie shells, imported from the distant Maldive Islands, became the small-denomination currency of daily commerce from the Atlantic to the Indian Ocean. Cloth strips, copper ingots, iron implements, and glass beads all served monetary functions in different contexts. The Kingdom of Aksum minted gold, silver, and bronze coinage --- one of only four ancient civilizations to do so. The Kilwa Sultanate produced its own copper coinage. These monetary innovations were African achievements, developed to meet African commercial needs.

Equally impressive was the organization of African markets and the merchant communities who animated them. The great markets of Timbuktu, Djenne, Kano, and Kilwa drew traders from across continents, operating under systems of regulation that enforced fair dealing, standardized measures, and resolved disputes. Professional merchant diasporas --- the Wangara/Dyula of West Africa, the Swahili traders of the coast, the Hausa merchants of the central Sudan --- maintained commercial networks spanning ecological zones and political boundaries. These communities developed sophisticated practices of credit, partnership, and trust that enabled long-distance trade in an era without banks, bills of exchange, or modern communication. The economic sophistication of pre-colonial Africa challenges any assumption of African "primitiveness" and demonstrates that African societies developed their own distinctive and effective responses to the challenges of commercial organization.

## Currency Systems

### Gold Dust and Gold Weights (West Africa)

Gold was the foundation of West Africa's economic relationship with the wider world. The gold fields of Bambuk (between the Senegal and Faleme rivers), Bure (upper Niger), and later the Akan goldfields (modern Ghana) produced the metal that flowed northward across the Sahara to finance the economies of the Mediterranean and Islamic worlds. Within West Africa itself, gold dust served as the primary medium for high-value transactions. [E]

**The Gold Dust System:**

Gold circulated not as coins but as dust (*tibr* in Arabic), which was weighed for each transaction. This system required:

- **Precise weighing instruments:** Merchants used balance scales of remarkable precision, capable of measuring fractions of a mitqal (approximately 4.25 grams)
- **Standardized weights:** Sets of weights calibrated to recognized standards allowed verification of quantities
- **Skilled evaluation:** Merchants needed expertise to assess gold purity and detect adulteration

The Akan peoples of the forest zone developed the most elaborate gold-weight system. Akan gold weights (*mrammuo*) were small brass castings --- often depicting geometric patterns, animals, human figures, or scenes from daily life --- each representing a specific weight value. A complete set might contain dozens of weights spanning a range from tiny fractions to substantial measures. These weights were both practical commercial tools and artistic expressions, their figurative designs often encoding proverbs, historical references, or social commentary. [E]

**Measurement Standards:**

West African gold measurement followed several overlapping systems:

- **The mitqal (mithqal):** The standard weight unit of the Islamic world, approximately 4.25 grams. This was the unit used in trans-Saharan trade, facilitating exchange with North African and Middle Eastern merchants.
- **Akan weight systems:** The Akan developed their own weight standards, eventually standardized as the *taku* (approximately 0.147 grams) and its multiples. The conversion between Akan and Islamic systems was well established.
- **Local variations:** Different regions might have slightly different standards, requiring adjustment when goods moved between zones. [P]

**Gold Nuggets vs. Dust:**

West African rulers distinguished between gold dust (which circulated freely) and gold nuggets (which were often claimed as royal property). Al-Bakri's eleventh-century account of the Ghana Empire describes how the king "keeps all the nuggets of gold for himself" while permitting only dust to circulate, a policy that maintained the metal's value and concentrated wealth at the court. This royal monopoly on nuggets appears to have been common across the gold-producing regions. [E]

**Confidence Assessment:** The gold dust system and Akan gold weights are [E] Established through abundant archaeological, ethnographic, and documentary evidence. Specific measurement standards varied regionally and remain [P] Probable in their precise historical calibrations.

### Salt (Trans-Saharan Trade)

Salt was, pound for pound, one of the most valuable commodities in the medieval Sahel --- sometimes said to exchange weight-for-weight with gold, though this proverbial exchange ratio was probably exceptional rather than typical. The physiological necessity of salt in the hot, humid tropics (where humans lose significant salt through perspiration) made it indispensable, while its scarcity in the savanna and forest zones made it precious. [E]

**Sources of Saharan Salt:**

The great Saharan salt deposits were formed by the evaporation of ancient seas:

- **Taghaza:** The most famous salt source on the western trans-Saharan routes. Ibn Battuta, visiting in 1352, described houses built from salt blocks, with salt so abundant it was used for construction yet so valuable it financed empires. The mines at Taghaza (and later Taoudenni, which replaced it) produced rock salt cut into standardized bars.
- **Bilma:** The primary salt source for the central trans-Saharan routes, located in the Kawar oasis chain of modern Niger. Bilma salt pans produced salt cakes that moved southward to the Hausa states and Kanem-Bornu.
- **Idjil:** Serving the westernmost routes toward the Atlantic coast.
- **Other sources:** Smaller salt sources throughout the Saharan zone contributed to regional trade. [E]

**Salt as Currency:**

Salt functioned as currency through standardization:

- **Salt bars/blocks:** Cut to recognized sizes and weights, salt bars could be exchanged at known values
- **Divisibility:** Large blocks could be broken into smaller units for lesser transactions
- **Regional variation:** The "purchasing power" of salt increased dramatically moving south from the production zones. A bar of salt worth little at Taghaza might purchase a slave in the forest zone --- an extreme ratio that Ibn Battuta and other travelers reported with amazement. [E]

**The Gold-Salt Exchange:**

The trans-Saharan trade rested fundamentally on the exchange of Saharan salt for West African gold:

```
Saharan mines (Taghaza, Bilma, etc.)
    | salt bars transported by camel
    v
Sahel trading cities (Timbuktu, Walata, Kano)
    | salt bars exchanged; redistributed southward
    v
Savanna and forest zones
    | gold dust flows northward in exchange
    v
Back to Sahel cities, then trans-Saharan routes
```

The immense labor required to produce, transport, and distribute Saharan salt --- digging in brutal desert conditions, loading camel caravans, crossing hundreds of miles of waterless terrain --- was justified by the salt's value at destination. The trade routes existed because the complementarity between salt-rich Sahara and gold-rich savanna was worth crossing the world's largest desert to exploit. [E]

**Confidence Assessment:** The salt trade and its role as currency are [E] Established through multiple Arabic sources (al-Bakri, Ibn Battuta, Leo Africanus) and archaeological evidence of salt distribution.

### Cowrie Shells

Cowrie shells represent one of history's most remarkable currency systems --- small marine shells from the distant Indian Ocean that became the standard small-denomination money across much of sub-Saharan Africa and beyond. Their use demonstrates the interconnection of African economies with global trade networks long before European contact. [E]

**Origins and Trade Routes:**

The cowries used as currency in Africa were primarily *Cypraea moneta* (the "money cowrie"), harvested in the Maldive Islands of the Indian Ocean. Their journey to Africa followed multiple routes:

- **Eastern route:** From the Maldives to the East African coast via Indian Ocean trade, then overland through the interior
- **Trans-Saharan route:** Cowries reached North Africa (possibly via Egypt and the Red Sea trade), then crossed the Sahara southward
- **Atlantic route (post-1500):** After European maritime expansion, cowries moved westward from Asia around Africa to the Atlantic coast

The scale of cowrie importation was enormous. Millions of shells entered African circulation over centuries, suggesting both the efficiency of the supply chains and the depth of African demand. [E]

**Cowries as Currency:**

Cowries possessed characteristics that made them excellent currency:

- **Durability:** The shells lasted indefinitely without degradation
- **Portability:** Light and easily transported
- **Divisibility:** Transactions could be denominated in single shells or multiples
- **Recognizability:** Genuine cowries were easily identified; counterfeiting was effectively impossible
- **Standardization:** Each shell was approximately equal in size and appearance
- **No inherent value for elites to monopolize:** Unlike gold, cowries could not be melted down or transformed; they functioned purely as money

**Denomination and Value:**

Cowries functioned as small-change currency for everyday transactions:

- **Counting units:** Cowries were counted individually or in standardized groups (strings of 40, bags of 20,000, etc., varying by region)
- **Relative value:** The exchange rate between cowries and other currencies fluctuated by time and place. In sixteenth-century Timbuktu, Leo Africanus reported that cowries were "brought hither out of the kingdom of Persia [i.e., via the Indian Ocean]" and used for "matters of small value"
- **Inflation over time:** As cowrie imports increased, their purchasing power generally declined --- a form of monetary inflation that accelerated after Portuguese and later Dutch traders began shipping cowries directly from Asia to the Atlantic coast [P]

**Geographic Distribution:**

Cowrie currency was most prevalent in:

- **West Africa:** The primary cowrie zone, from the Sahel to the forest coast
- **The Lake Chad basin:** Kanem-Bornu and surrounding regions
- **Parts of East Africa:** Though less dominant than other currencies

Cowries were less significant in:

- **The Swahili Coast:** Where other currencies (cloth, beads, the coastal cities' own coins) predominated
- **The Ethiopian highlands:** Where Aksumite coinage and later salt bars (*amole*) were primary

**Confidence Assessment:** Cowrie use as currency is [E] Established through abundant documentary, archaeological, and ethnographic evidence. Specific exchange rates and regional variations are [P] Probable, reconstructed from fragmentary sources.

---

### Cloth Currencies

Cloth strips and standardized textile units served as currency across much of sub-Saharan Africa, reflecting both the high value placed on textiles and the relative scarcity of fine cloth in many regions. Cloth currency was particularly important where gold was unavailable and cowries were insufficient for larger transactions. [P]

**West African Cloth Currency:**

In West Africa, several types of cloth served monetary functions:

- **Cotton strips:** Narrow strips of locally woven cotton cloth, woven on traditional looms, could be counted and exchanged at standardized values. The strips were often dyed (indigo was particularly valued) and could be sewn together for garments or accumulated as wealth.
- **Imported cloth:** Fine textiles from North Africa, the Mediterranean, and (increasingly) India commanded premium values and served as prestige goods that could be exchanged for other valuables.
- **The "Guinea cloth" of later periods:** Standardized textile units that European traders eventually adopted as a trading currency on the Atlantic coast. [P]

**Kano and Hausa Cloth:**

The Hausa city of Kano was famous for its textile production, particularly the indigo-dyed cloth (*riga*) produced in the city's ancient dye pits:

- Kano cloth was traded across the Sahel and Sahara, reaching markets in North Africa
- The quality of Kano dyeing created brand-name value --- cloth dyed in Kano commanded premiums over cloth dyed elsewhere
- Cloth strips could serve directly as currency or as trade goods exchangeable for other currencies [E]

**Swahili Coast Cloth:**

On the East African coast, cloth (particularly imported Indian textiles) served important monetary functions:

- Indian cloth from Gujarat and other regions was a primary import
- Cloth could be used to purchase interior goods (ivory, gold, slaves)
- Standardized cloth units facilitated transactions without counting individual shells or weighing gold [P]

**Advantages of Cloth Currency:**

Cloth as currency offered several benefits:

- **Intrinsic utility:** Unlike shells, cloth could eventually be used for clothing
- **Storability:** Properly maintained cloth could be stored for years
- **Quality gradations:** Different cloth types created natural denominations
- **Portability:** Rolled or folded cloth was relatively easy to transport

**Confidence Assessment:** Cloth currency use is [P] Probable to [E] Established depending on region and period. Documentation is better for the Atlantic trade period than for earlier centuries.

### Copper and Brass Currencies

Copper and its alloys (bronze, brass) served important monetary functions across sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in regions where these metals were scarce and in international trade contexts where they commanded value. [E]

**Copper Crosses (Katanga/Central Africa):**

The copper-producing regions of Central Africa (particularly Katanga, in modern Democratic Republic of Congo) developed distinctive copper ingots:

- **Cross-shaped ingots:** The famous "copper crosses" (*handa*) of Katanga were cast in standardized X-shapes that facilitated counting and transport
- **Weight standards:** Different sizes of crosses corresponded to different values
- **Regional trade:** Copper crosses circulated widely in Central African trade networks, predating and continuing alongside European contact
- **Dating:** Copper cross production likely began before 1000 CE, with the tradition continuing for centuries [E]

**Copper Manillas (West Africa):**

Manillas were horseshoe-shaped copper or brass objects that served as currency in the West African coastal trade:

- **Shape:** Distinctive curved form, open at one end
- **Use:** Manillas circulated as currency and as raw material for bronze-casting (in Benin and elsewhere)
- **Atlantic trade:** European traders adopted manillas as a trading currency, importing millions from Europe to exchange for African goods
- **Benin connection:** The bronze-casters of Benin melted down manillas as a primary source of metal for their famous sculptures [E]

**Brass and Copper Goods:**

Beyond standardized currency forms, worked copper and brass objects served as stores of value:

- **Basins, bowls, and vessels:** Imported from North Africa or produced locally, these could be exchanged or melted
- **Jewelry:** Copper and brass ornaments represented portable wealth
- **Status markers:** The display of copper and brass indicated wealth and social position

**Confidence Assessment:** Copper currencies are [E] Established through archaeological evidence (copper crosses, manillas) and documentary sources (Portuguese accounts of manilla trade).

---

### Iron Currencies

Iron, the essential metal for tools and weapons, served monetary functions across sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in regions where iron smelting was locally practiced but iron goods remained valuable. [P]

**Iron Hoes and Agricultural Implements:**

Agricultural tools, particularly hoes, circulated as currency in many regions:

- **Bride-wealth:** Iron hoes commonly featured in bride-wealth payments, representing both economic value and symbolic fertility
- **Standardized forms:** Hoe-money was often produced in specific shapes distinct from functional tools, indicating purely monetary use
- **Regional variation:** Different shapes of iron currency characterized different regions [P]

**Iron Bars:**

Iron bars or ingots served similar functions:

- **Standard weights:** Bars of approximately consistent size facilitated exchange
- **Raw material:** Iron bars could be worked into tools or weapons, giving them intrinsic utility
- **Trade currency:** In some regions, iron bars became the standard unit of commercial exchange [P]

**The Kissi Penny (Later Period):**

The Kissi people of the Guinea highlands developed distinctive iron currency:

- Long, thin iron rods with flattened ends
- Named denominations with specific values
- Continued in use into the colonial period, providing ethnographic documentation of iron currency systems

**Confidence Assessment:** Iron currencies are [P] Probable based on ethnographic evidence and archaeological finds, though documentation for the medieval period is less complete than for metals like gold and copper.

---

### Glass Beads

Glass beads, imported from across the Indian Ocean and later the Atlantic, served important monetary and symbolic functions in African commerce. [E]

**Indian Ocean Beads:**

For the Swahili Coast and Indian Ocean trade zones, glass beads were a primary import:

- **Origins:** Produced in South Asia (India), the Middle East, and eventually Venice
- **Varieties:** Hundreds of bead types have been identified archaeologically, distinguished by color, size, pattern, and manufacturing technique
- **Dating value:** Because bead styles changed over time and their production sites are known, archaeologists can use beads to date African sites
- **Currency function:** Beads served as small-denomination currency and as trade goods for the interior [E]

**Trans-Saharan Beads:**

Glass beads also moved across the Sahara:

- Mediterranean and Middle Eastern beads reached the Sahel
- Beads feature prominently in elite graves and royal treasuries
- The appearance of certain bead types marks participation in long-distance trade networks [E]

**Symbolic Value:**

Beyond their monetary function, beads carried symbolic significance:

- **Status markers:** Certain bead types indicated elite status
- **Religious significance:** Some beads held protective or spiritual power
- **Regional preferences:** Different communities valued specific bead colors and patterns

**Confidence Assessment:** Bead trade and monetary use are [E] Established through abundant archaeological evidence. The beads themselves provide some of the best chronological markers for African sites.

### Aksumite Coinage

The Kingdom of Aksum was the only sub-Saharan African state to develop a fully indigenous coinage system before the early modern period --- one of only four ancient civilizations (along with Rome, Persia, and India) to mint coins in precious metals. This achievement reflects Aksum's economic sophistication and its integration into the monetary economy of the late antique world. [E]

**The Coinage System:**

Aksumite coinage comprised three metals:

**Gold Coins:**
- Calibrated to the Roman solidus standard (approximately 4.5 grams), facilitating international trade
- Bear royal portraits and inscriptions in Ge'ez and Greek
- Symbolism evolved: pre-Christian coins show the disc-and-crescent; post-Christian coins display the cross
- Primarily used for international commerce and royal transactions

**Silver Coins:**
- Less common than gold
- Used for intermediate-value transactions
- Similar designs to gold coinage

**Bronze Coins:**
- The small-denomination currency for everyday commerce
- More abundant than precious-metal coins
- Found throughout the Aksumite realm and trade network [E]

**Chronology:**

- **Earliest coinage:** Late second or early third century CE
- **Peak production:** Fourth through sixth centuries CE (Aksum's political height)
- **Decline:** Seventh century CE, as trade revenues collapsed following the Arab conquests
- **End of minting:** Probably seventh century; the exact date is uncertain [P]

**The Christian Transformation:**

Ezana's conversion to Christianity (c. 330 CE) is visible on the coinage:

- **Pre-conversion coins:** Disc-and-crescent symbol (probably astronomical/religious significance)
- **Post-conversion coins:** Christian cross replaces pre-Christian symbols
- This numismatic evidence provides independent confirmation of the religious transformation described in inscriptions

**Economic Significance:**

The existence of Aksumite coinage demonstrates:

- Control of sufficient gold to maintain currency production
- Technical capacity for die-cutting and minting
- Integration into international monetary systems (the solidus standard)
- A monetized economy at least among elites and in commercial centers

**Confidence Assessment:** Aksumite coinage is [E] Established through abundant numismatic evidence. Thousands of coins survive, allowing detailed study of types, weights, and chronology.

---

### Kilwa Coinage

The Kilwa Sultanate on the Swahili Coast was the only medieval sub-Saharan state (outside Ethiopia) to mint its own coinage --- copper coins (*fulūs*) that circulated along the coast and provide valuable evidence for Kilwa's commercial sophistication. [E]

**The Coins:**

Kilwa coins were small copper pieces:

- **Material:** Copper (or copper alloy)
- **Shape:** Generally round, with variations
- **Inscriptions:** Arabic script, typically bearing the sultan's name and titles
- **Value:** Small denomination; used for everyday transactions rather than major commerce

**Dating and Attribution:**

Coins bearing sultans' names help establish Kilwa's chronology:

- Coins of "al-Hasan ibn Sulaiman" correlate with the sultan traditionally dated to c. 1310-1333 (the probable builder of Husuni Kubwa)
- The coin sequence provides evidence for rulers whose reigns are otherwise poorly documented
- Some attributions remain [D] Debated due to common names and uncertain dating [P]

**Distribution:**

Kilwa coins have been found:

- At Kilwa itself (abundantly)
- At other Swahili Coast sites
- Occasionally in the interior trade zone

This distribution confirms Kilwa's commercial centrality and the circulation of its currency within a defined zone.

**Economic Implications:**

The minting of coinage indicates:

- Sufficient administrative capacity to control currency production
- A monetized economy at least for certain transactions
- The sultan's authority expressed through monetary control

**Confidence Assessment:** Kilwa coinage is [E] Established through archaeological recovery of coins. Attribution of specific coins to specific sultans is [P] Probable based on inscription reading, with some identifications [D] Debated.

## Credit and Accounting

### Merchant Credit Systems

African long-distance trade operated on credit systems that enabled goods to move across vast distances before final settlement of accounts. These systems, developed independently of European banking traditions, reflected sophisticated commercial practice. [P]

**The Logic of Credit Trade:**

Long-distance trade in Africa necessarily involved credit because:

- **Time delays:** Goods moved slowly (camel caravans, river boats, head porterage); the round-trip between trading partners could take months or years
- **Seasonal patterns:** The monsoon cycle on the Indian Ocean, the dry season for Saharan travel, and agricultural calendars all constrained when goods could move
- **Multiple intermediaries:** Goods often passed through several hands between producer and final consumer

**Credit Mechanisms:**

Several mechanisms enabled credit trade:

**Advance payment:**
- Merchants provided goods on credit with the expectation of return goods or payment on the next trading cycle
- Example: A Swahili merchant might advance cloth to an interior trader, expecting ivory in return when the caravan returned months later

**Partnership arrangements:**
- Two or more merchants might pool resources, share risks, and divide profits according to agreed formulas
- Islamic commercial law (*fiqh al-mu'amalat*) provided sophisticated frameworks for partnership (*musharika*, *mudaraba*) that Muslim merchants used throughout Africa

**Trust networks:**
- Long-distance credit depended on trust --- confidence that distant partners would honor their obligations
- Trust was built and maintained through kinship, shared ethnic/religious identity, repeated interactions, and reputation
- Defaulting on obligations could destroy a merchant's reputation and end their commercial career [P]

**Confidence Assessment:** Credit practices are [P] Probable based on comparative evidence and the logic of trade systems, though direct documentation for the African interior is limited.

---

### Debt Relationships

Beyond commercial credit, various debt relationships structured economic life in African societies. [P]

**Productive Loans:**

Merchants and farmers might borrow to finance:

- Trade ventures (purchase of goods for resale)
- Agricultural expansion (seeds, tools, labor)
- Emergency needs (famines, family crises)

**Pawnship:**

A distinctive African institution, pawnship involved:

- A person (often a family member of the debtor) placed in the creditor's household
- The pawn's labor served as interest on the debt
- The pawn was returned when the principal was repaid
- Unlike chattel slavery, pawnship was temporary and the pawn retained certain rights

Pawnship was widespread across West and Central Africa, serving as a mechanism for mobilizing credit in economies without formal banking. [P]

**Debt Slavery:**

In some cases, unpaid debts led to enslavement:

- Debtors unable to repay might be enslaved by creditors
- Family members might be surrendered to satisfy debts
- This mechanism connected debt, poverty, and servitude in ways that complicate the distinction between "free" and "unfree" status [P]

**Confidence Assessment:** Debt relationships are documented through ethnographic and later historical sources. Their prevalence in the medieval period is [P] Probable through analogy.

---

### Trust Networks

The operation of long-distance trade without formal banking, legal enforcement across jurisdictions, or rapid communication depended on trust networks that connected merchants across vast distances. [P]

**Kinship Networks:**

Family ties provided the foundation of commercial trust:

- Merchants placed sons, nephews, and other relatives at trading stations
- Goods could move between family members with confidence in fair dealing
- Inheritance transmitted commercial knowledge and relationships across generations

**Ethnic/Religious Networks:**

Shared identity created trust beyond kinship:

- **The Wangara/Dyula:** Mande-speaking Muslim merchants maintained commercial networks spanning West Africa, recognizing each other as members of a commercial community bound by shared identity, language, and religion
- **Swahili merchants:** Coastal traders recognized each other through shared Swahili language, Islamic practice, and commercial culture
- **Arab and Berber merchants:** Saharan traders maintained networks extending from North Africa into the Sahel

**Reputation Systems:**

Trust was earned and maintained through:

- **Track record:** Merchants who consistently honored obligations built reputations that opened credit
- **Community enforcement:** Merchants who cheated partners faced ostracism from the commercial community
- **Religious sanction:** For Muslim merchants, commercial dishonesty was sinful; the expectation of divine judgment reinforced honest dealing

**Confidence Assessment:** Trust networks are [P] Probable based on the logic of the trade systems and later ethnographic evidence. Specific mechanisms for the medieval period are inferred rather than directly documented.

---

### Record-Keeping

Evidence for formal record-keeping in African commerce is limited but suggestive. [S]

**Written Records:**

In Islamized trading communities:

- Literate merchants could maintain written accounts
- Arabic script (and later Ajami --- African languages written in Arabic script) provided tools for record-keeping
- Islamic commercial law required certain documentation (witnesses, contracts)

However, the survival of such records is minimal. The Timbuktu manuscripts include some commercial correspondence but few systematic account books have been identified.

**Non-Written Systems:**

Where literacy was limited, merchants likely used:

- Memory (professional traders developed remarkable memory skills)
- Material records (knotted cords, notched sticks, arranged objects)
- Witnesses (transactions conducted before witnesses who could testify to terms)

**Archaeological Implications:**

Weights and measures recovered archaeologically imply accounting:

- Akan gold weights were used for precise measurement
- The standardization of weights indicates systematic commercial practice
- But the weights themselves do not reveal the accounting systems that employed them

**Confidence Assessment:** Record-keeping practices are [S] Speculative for most regions, with some [P] Probable evidence for literate Muslim merchant communities.

## Major Markets

### Timbuktu Markets

Timbuktu, at its height in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, was one of the greatest commercial centers in the medieval world --- a place where the trans-Saharan caravan trade met the Niger River boat traffic, where gold met salt, and where merchants from across the Islamic world gathered to trade. [E]

**Market Organization:**

Timbuktu's markets were organized by specialty:

- **The book market:** Leo Africanus (c. 1510-1512) noted that "manuscripts or written books... are sold for more money than any other merchandise" --- a distinctive feature reflecting Timbuktu's scholarly culture
- **The salt market:** Where blocks of Saharan salt were bought and sold
- **The gold market:** Where gold dust changed hands, weighed on precise scales
- **General markets:** For everyday goods, foodstuffs, cloth, and livestock

**Commercial Infrastructure:**

The city provided facilities for trade:

- **Caravanserais:** Lodging for merchants and their animals
- **Warehouses:** Storage for goods awaiting sale or transport
- **Commercial brokers:** Intermediaries who connected buyers and sellers
- **Money-changers:** Converting between currencies [P]

**Market Regulation:**

Islamic commercial law provided the framework:

- **Standardized weights and measures:** Enforced by market officials
- **The qadi's court:** Adjudicating commercial disputes
- **Islamic commercial ethics:** Prohibitions on fraud, usury, and unfair dealing

**Confidence Assessment:** Timbuktu's commercial importance is [E] Established through multiple sources (Leo Africanus, Ibn Battuta, the Timbuktu chronicles). Specific market organization is [P] Probable based on these sources and comparison with other Islamic commercial centers.

---

### Djenne as Commercial Hub

Djenne, in the inland Niger delta, was the second great commercial center of the Middle Niger region --- a city that controlled the transshipment of goods between the river trade and the overland routes, and that may have preceded Timbuktu as a commercial hub. [E]

**Strategic Position:**

Djenne occupied an ideal position:

- At the heart of the inland Niger delta, accessible by water
- Surrounded by seasonally flooded agricultural land
- Connected to Timbuktu by the Niger River (approximately 400 km downstream)
- Connected to the gold-producing regions to the south

**Market Functions:**

Djenne served as a transshipment point:

- Gold and kola nuts from the forest zone moved through Djenne northward
- Salt and Saharan goods moved through Djenne southward
- The city's merchants maintained networks in both directions

**The Market:**

The *Tarikh al-Sudan* and other sources describe Djenne's commercial vitality:

- A daily market serving local needs
- Periodic larger markets drawing regional traders
- Specialized trading in gold, salt, cloth, and other commodities

**Relationship to Timbuktu:**

Djenne and Timbuktu operated as complementary centers:

- Djenne dominated the southern trade (forest zone connections)
- Timbuktu dominated the northern trade (trans-Saharan connections)
- Goods often moved between the two cities as part of longer trade routes

**Confidence Assessment:** Djenne's commercial importance is [E] Established through the Timbuktu chronicles and archaeological evidence (particularly the ancient site of Jenne-Jeno). Market organization is [P] Probable by analogy with Timbuktu.

---

### Kurmi Market (Kano)

Kurmi market in Kano was one of the great markets of West Africa --- a commercial center that drew traders from across the Sahel and established Kano's reputation as a premier trading destination. Its foundation is traditionally attributed to Sultan Muhammad Rumfa (r. 1463-1499), though markets certainly existed in Kano before his reign. [P]

**Scale and Organization:**

The Kurmi market was a massive commercial complex:

- **Physical extent:** Occupying a large area in the southern part of Kano's walled city
- **Specialized sections:** Different areas for different commodities:
  - Cloth and textiles (Kano's famous indigo-dyed cloth)
  - Leather goods
  - Grain and foodstuffs
  - Livestock
  - Salt
  - Enslaved people (a significant trade)
  - And other specialties

**Market Officials:**

The market was regulated:

- **The market chief (*sarkin kasuwa*):** Overall authority over market operations
- **Section chiefs:** Overseeing specific commodity areas
- **Inspectors:** Enforcing weights, measures, and fair dealing
- **The qadi:** Adjudicating disputes according to Islamic law

**Commercial Practices:**

Kano's market operated with sophisticated practices:

- **Multiple currencies:** Cowrie shells, cloth strips, gold dust all circulated
- **Credit arrangements:** Established traders extended credit to reliable partners
- **Commercial hospitality:** Foreign merchants received lodging and trading facilities

**Kano's Specialties:**

The market was particularly famous for:

- **Indigo-dyed cloth:** The deep blue *riga* (robe) produced in Kano's dye pits commanded premiums across West Africa
- **Leather goods:** "Morocco leather" was often actually produced in Kano and exported northward
- **Kola nut distribution:** Kola from the forest zone was redistributed northward

**Confidence Assessment:** Kurmi market's existence and importance are [P] Probable to [E] Established based on the Kano Chronicle and early modern European accounts. Specific organizational details are reconstructed from later evidence.

### Swahili Port Markets

The Swahili Coast cities --- Kilwa, Mombasa, Malindi, Mogadishu, and others --- were maritime commercial centers oriented toward Indian Ocean trade. Their markets reflected this orientation, serving as transshipment points where African goods met Asian imports. [E]

**The Trading Season:**

Market activity on the Swahili Coast followed the monsoon rhythm:

- **November-March (northeast monsoon):** Ships arrived from Arabia and India; markets were at their busiest
- **April-September (southwest monsoon):** Ships departed; markets quieted
- Foreign merchants spent months in port, creating a seasonal commercial community

**Market Organization:**

Swahili markets served multiple functions:

- **Wholesale trade:** Large-scale transactions between foreign merchants and Swahili traders
- **Retail trade:** Daily markets serving urban populations
- **Harbor services:** Provisioning ships, providing storage, arranging transport

**Trade Goods:**

The markets exchanged:

**African exports:**
- Gold (from the Zimbabwe Plateau via Sofala and Kilwa)
- Ivory (from across the interior)
- Enslaved people (a significant trade)
- Mangrove poles (for Arabian construction)
- Iron, ambergris, other African products

**Asian imports:**
- Textiles (particularly Indian cloth from Gujarat)
- Ceramics (Chinese porcelain, Persian pottery)
- Glass beads (from India)
- Metalware, weapons, and manufactured goods

**Currency in Swahili Trade:**

Multiple currencies circulated:

- **Cloth:** Standardized textile units
- **Beads:** Glass beads from India
- **Kilwa coins:** The sultanate's copper currency
- **Foreign currencies:** Arabian, Indian, and other currencies brought by visiting merchants
- **Credit:** Arrangements for deferred payment [E]

**Confidence Assessment:** Swahili markets are [E] Established through Ibn Battuta's account, Portuguese sources, and archaeological evidence.

### Benin City Markets

Benin City, capital of the Kingdom of Benin in the West African forest zone, was a major urban center with organized market facilities. European visitors from the fifteenth century onward described a sophisticated commercial system. [P]

**Market Structure:**

Benin City contained multiple markets:

- **The main market:** A large daily market serving the urban population
- **Specialized markets:** For particular goods or purposes
- **Palace-connected commerce:** Trade linked to royal consumption and patronage

**Market Goods:**

The markets traded:

- **Local produce:** Yams, palm oil, plantains, vegetables
- **Craft products:** Cloth, pottery, metalwork (though bronze-casting was a royal monopoly)
- **Trade goods:** Pepper, ivory, and (post-1485) European imports

**Currency:**

Multiple currencies operated:

- **Cowrie shells:** The standard small-denomination currency
- **Manillas:** Copper/brass objects used as currency and as raw material for bronze-casting
- **Barter:** Direct exchange of goods remained significant

**Royal Control:**

The Oba exercised significant control over trade:

- Certain goods (especially materials for bronze-casting) were royal monopolies
- Foreign traders required royal permission
- The palace was the ultimate market for prestige goods

**Confidence Assessment:** Benin markets are [P] Probable to [E] Established based on Portuguese and Dutch accounts, which consistently describe commercial activity though with varying detail.

---

### Market Days and Cycles

Across sub-Saharan Africa, markets typically operated on cyclical schedules rather than continuously. These market-day cycles coordinated commercial activity across regions. [P]

**The Market Week:**

Different regions used different market cycles:

- **Four-day cycles:** Common in parts of West Africa
- **Seven-day cycles:** In Islamized areas, reflecting the Islamic week
- **Other cycles:** Eight-day, ten-day, and other periodicities documented in various regions

**Rotating Markets:**

In many areas, markets rotated among several locations:

- Each village or town might host a market on a specific day of the cycle
- Traders moved from market to market following the rotation
- This system extended market access across larger areas while concentrating commercial activity

**Economic Logic:**

The market-day system reflected economic realities:

- **Labor allocation:** Farmers could attend market periodically while maintaining agricultural work
- **Concentration:** Gathering buyers and sellers on specific days increased commercial efficiency
- **Social functions:** Market days served social as well as economic purposes --- news exchange, social gatherings, political meetings

**Confidence Assessment:** Market cycles are [P] Probable based on widespread later documentation, though specific patterns for the medieval period are reconstructed rather than directly attested.

---

## Market Organization

### Market Officials

African markets were typically regulated by appointed officials who maintained order, enforced standards, and resolved disputes. The specifics varied by region and political system. [P]

**West African Market Officials:**

In the Islamized cities of the Sahel:

- **The muhtasib (or equivalent):** An official responsible for market regulation, drawn from Islamic tradition. Duties included:
  - Inspecting weights and measures
  - Ensuring product quality
  - Preventing fraud and hoarding
  - Maintaining public morality in the market

- **Specialized officials:** For particular commodities or sections of the market

In Hausa cities like Kano:

- **Sarkin kasuwa (chief of the market):** Overall authority
- **Section chiefs:** Overseeing specific trade areas
- **The Emir's oversight:** Ultimate authority resting with the political ruler

**Swahili Coast:**

Market regulation was connected to sultanic authority:

- Customs collection at ports
- Regulation of foreign merchants
- Dispute resolution through the qadi's court

**General Principles:**

Across regions, market officials typically:

- Maintained order and prevented violence
- Enforced standardized weights and measures
- Collected market taxes and fees
- Arbitrated disputes
- Excluded fraudulent or dangerous goods

**Confidence Assessment:** Market officials are [P] Probable based on later documentation and comparative evidence. Specific titles and functions varied regionally.

---

### Standardization of Weights and Measures

The operation of commerce across cultural and linguistic boundaries required some standardization of weights and measures. African merchants developed or adopted various standards. [E]

**Weight Standards:**

**For gold:**
- The mitqal (approximately 4.25 grams) served as the standard unit in trans-Saharan trade
- Akan gold weights provided precise measurement calibrated to local and international standards
- Balance scales were essential equipment for gold traders

**For salt:**
- Salt blocks were cut to standardized sizes at the mines
- Regional variations existed, but merchants knew the expected weights

**For other goods:**
- Various measures for grain, cloth, and other commodities
- Standardization was more consistent for high-value goods than for everyday commodities

**Volume and Length Measures:**

- **Cloth:** Measured by length (arm-spans, cubits) or by standardized "pieces"
- **Grain:** Measured by volume using standard containers
- **Liquids:** Measured in standard vessels

**Regional Variation:**

Standards varied between regions, requiring merchants to know conversion factors:

- Akan weights differed from mitqal weights
- Different cities might use different container sizes
- Experienced merchants knew these variations

**Confidence Assessment:** Weight standardization for precious commodities is [E] Established through archaeological evidence (weights, scales) and documentary sources. Standardization for everyday goods is [P] Probable but less well documented.

---

### Price Regulation

The extent to which African states regulated prices varied by region and commodity. [P]

**Royal Monopolies:**

Certain commodities were subject to royal price control:

- **Gold nuggets:** Reserved for rulers in Ghana and elsewhere
- **Strategic imports:** Bronze/brass for Benin's casters, horses for cavalry states
- **Prestige goods:** Coral beads, Chinese porcelain, and other elite imports

**Market Prices:**

For most goods, prices were determined by supply, demand, and negotiation:

- Haggling was normal practice
- Seasonal variations affected prices (salt was cheapest when caravans arrived)
- Information asymmetries created price variations

**Islamic Commercial Law:**

In Islamized markets, certain regulations applied:

- Prohibition of *riba* (usury/interest)
- Requirements for fair dealing
- Restrictions on hoarding to manipulate prices

**Confidence Assessment:** Price regulation is [P] Probable based on documented royal monopolies and Islamic commercial practice. Systematic price controls for common goods are [S] Speculative.

---

### Dispute Resolution

Commercial disputes required resolution mechanisms that could operate across cultural and political boundaries. [P]

**Qadi Courts:**

In Islamized regions, the qadi (Islamic judge) adjudicated commercial disputes:

- Applied Islamic commercial law (*fiqh al-mu'amalat*)
- Heard testimony and examined evidence
- Issued binding judgments
- Maintained records of transactions and decisions

The qadi system provided a common legal framework that Muslim merchants could rely on from Timbuktu to Kilwa.

**Merchant Arbitration:**

Within merchant communities, disputes were often resolved internally:

- Respected merchants served as arbitrators
- Community pressure enforced decisions
- Exclusion from commercial networks punished those who violated norms

**Political Authority:**

Rulers sometimes intervened in commercial disputes:

- Royal courts might adjudicate cases involving subjects
- Foreign merchants appealing to local rulers for protection or redress
- State enforcement of market regulations

**Customary Practices:**

Where formal institutions were absent, customary mechanisms operated:

- Oaths and ordeals
- Community assemblies
- Mediation by elders

**Confidence Assessment:** Dispute resolution mechanisms are [P] Probable based on the requirements of commercial systems and documented Islamic legal practice.

---

## Merchant Communities

### Wangara/Dyula Merchants (West Africa)

The Wangara (also called Dyula, Juula, or Dioula) were the great long-distance traders of West Africa --- a Mande-speaking, Muslim merchant diaspora whose commercial networks connected the gold-producing regions of the forest zone to the Sahel cities and trans-Saharan routes. [E]

**Origins and Identity:**

The Wangara were:

- **Linguistically Mande:** Speakers of Mande languages (related to Bambara, Mandinka)
- **Religiously Muslim:** Islam was central to Wangara identity and commercial practice
- **Professionally traders:** Commerce was their defining occupation
- **Diaspora communities:** Wangara settlements existed throughout West Africa, from the forest edge to the Sahel

**Commercial Networks:**

Wangara merchants dominated the gold trade:

- Maintained relationships with gold-producing communities in Bambuk, Bure, and the Akan region
- Controlled the movement of gold northward to Sahel cities
- Operated in partnership networks spanning vast distances

**The "Silent Trade" Question:**

Arabic sources describe a "silent trade" in which Wangara and gold producers exchanged goods without direct contact:

- Merchants deposited salt at designated locations
- Gold was left in exchange by producers who never appeared
- The practice (if it existed) may have protected the secrecy of gold sources

Modern scholars debate whether this practice was real or a misunderstanding by Arabic authors unfamiliar with actual trading mechanisms. [D]

**Cultural Role:**

Wangara merchants served as vectors of Islamization:

- Their settlements became nuclei of Muslim communities in non-Muslim regions
- They built mosques, established Quranic schools, and spread Islamic practice
- The association between Islam and commerce reinforced both

**Confidence Assessment:** The Wangara as a merchant community are [E] Established through Arabic sources and later documentation. Specific commercial practices are [P] Probable; the "silent trade" is [D] Debated.

---

### Swahili Traders

The Swahili --- the Bantu-speaking Muslim peoples of the East African coast --- were maritime traders who connected African resources to the Indian Ocean world. They were not merely middlemen but active commercial agents who shaped the terms of trade. [E]

**Swahili Commercial Culture:**

Swahili merchants:

- **Sailed:** Swahili ships traveled to Arabian ports; Swahili merchants were present in Aden and other overseas centers
- **Controlled access:** Swahili cities regulated who could trade and on what terms
- **Maintained networks:** Commercial relationships connected coastal cities to each other and to the interior
- **Adapted:** Swahili commercial practice incorporated Islamic law, Indian Ocean conventions, and local customs

**Interior Trade:**

Swahili commerce extended into the African interior:

- Ivory, gold, and enslaved people moved from interior to coast
- Cloth, beads, and other imports moved from coast to interior
- Swahili traders maintained relationships with interior trading partners

**The Kilwa-Sofala Connection:**

Kilwa's commercial dominance rested on controlling the Sofala gold route:

- Sofala (in modern Mozambique) was the coastal outlet for Zimbabwe Plateau gold
- Kilwa established authority over Sofala (by conquest, diplomacy, or alliance --- sources vary)
- Gold moving from Sofala northward passed through Kilwa
- Kilwa merchants set terms for the onward trade to Indian Ocean markets [E]

**Confidence Assessment:** Swahili commercial activity is [E] Established through Ibn Battuta, Portuguese sources, and archaeological evidence.

---

### Hausa Traders

The Hausa city-states of the central Sudan developed sophisticated commercial networks connecting trans-Saharan trade to the forest zone and spanning the breadth of West Africa. [P]

**Hausa Commercial Networks:**

Hausa traders (*fatake*) operated throughout West Africa:

- Purchasing goods in distant markets
- Transporting goods across ecological zones
- Maintaining commercial relationships across political boundaries

**Specializations:**

Hausa commerce was known for:

- **Textiles:** Distributing Kano cloth across the region
- **Kola:** Moving kola nuts from the forest zone northward
- **Livestock:** Trading cattle, horses, and other animals
- **General merchandise:** Carrying goods of all types

**The "Hausa Diaspora":**

Hausa trading communities (*zongo*) existed throughout West Africa:

- Resident merchant quarters in non-Hausa cities
- Providing hospitality, information, and commercial connections for traveling traders
- Maintaining Hausa language, culture, and (often) Islam in host communities

**Confidence Assessment:** Hausa trading networks are [P] Probable for the medieval period based on later documentation; the networks clearly existed by the time of detailed European observation.

---

### Women Traders

Women participated significantly in African commerce, though their role is often underrepresented in sources written by male observers. [P]

**Market Trading:**

Women were prominent in local market trading:

- Selling food, prepared dishes, and agricultural produce
- Controlling retail trade in many commodities
- Managing household commerce

**Long-Distance Trade:**

Women's participation in long-distance trade varied:

- Some women were wealthy traders in their own right
- Widows might continue deceased husbands' commercial activities
- Women's mobility was more restricted in some societies than others

**Gender and Commodity:**

Certain trades were gendered:

- Food preparation and sale was often women's work
- Some craft production (pottery, textiles) was gender-specific
- High-value long-distance trade in prestige goods was more often male-dominated

**Elite Women:**

Royal and elite women sometimes controlled significant commercial resources:

- Queen mothers, royal wives, and noble women might manage trade on their own account
- Women's quarters in palaces had economic as well as domestic functions

**Confidence Assessment:** Women's trading roles are [P] Probable based on ethnographic evidence and occasional documentary references, though systematic documentation is lacking for the medieval period.

---

## State Role in Economy

### Royal Monopolies

African rulers typically claimed monopoly control over certain valuable commodities, using this control to generate revenue and maintain political authority. [E]

**Gold Monopolies (West Africa):**

The most important monopolies concerned gold:

- **Nuggets vs. dust:** The Ghana kings reportedly claimed all gold nuggets, allowing only dust to circulate. This concentrated wealth at the court and controlled the gold supply.
- **First right of purchase:** Rulers might claim the right to purchase gold before other buyers
- **Export taxation:** Even where private trade was permitted, rulers taxed gold exports

**Salt Control:**

Rulers who controlled salt sources (or access to salt routes) could:

- Tax salt at its source or at market entry
- Regulate salt distribution
- Use salt access as political leverage

**Strategic Imports:**

Rulers often monopolized strategically important imports:

- **Horses:** Cavalry was the elite military arm; controlling horse supply was controlling military power
- **Metals:** Bronze and copper for prestige goods (particularly in Benin)
- **Firearms:** After their introduction, firearms became strategic goods

**Prestige Goods:**

Certain luxury imports were royal monopolies:

- Chinese porcelain, coral beads, fine textiles
- Items used in royal regalia and court display
- Goods whose possession marked elite status

**Confidence Assessment:** Royal monopolies are [E] Established for gold and certain other commodities through multiple sources.

---

### Taxation

African states extracted revenue through various taxation mechanisms. [P]

**Trade Taxes:**

Commerce was a primary tax target:

- **Customs duties:** Taxes on goods entering or leaving controlled territories
- **Market fees:** Charges for market access or for specific transactions
- **Transit dues:** Payments for passing through controlled routes

**Examples:**

- Al-Bakri describes the Ghana king taxing both salt imports and gold exports
- Swahili sultans collected customs at their ports
- Hausa emirs taxed market transactions

**Agricultural Taxation:**

Revenue also came from agricultural production:

- **Tribute:** Subject communities providing goods or labor
- **Tithe (*zakat*):** In Islamized states, the religious tax on wealth
- **Land-based taxation:** Where applicable

**Labor Extraction:**

Labor could substitute for goods:

- Corvee labor for public works (walls, roads, palaces)
- Military service
- Porterage and transport duties

**Confidence Assessment:** Taxation practices are [P] Probable based on documented examples, though systematic evidence is limited.

---

### Price Controls

Some African states attempted to control prices, particularly for strategic goods. [S]

**Salt Prices:**

Where rulers controlled salt supply, they could influence prices:

- Releasing salt to lower prices
- Restricting supply to raise prices
- Setting official prices for government purchases

**Grain Prices:**

In times of scarcity, rulers might:

- Open royal granaries to stabilize prices
- Prohibit export to keep supplies local
- Set maximum prices to prevent gouging

**Limits of Control:**

Price control capacity was limited by:

- Enforcement difficulties
- Smuggling and black markets
- Limited administrative apparatus

**Confidence Assessment:** Price controls are [S] Speculative for most contexts. Rulers clearly influenced prices through monopoly control of commodities, but systematic price regulation is not well documented.

---

### Trade Protection

States invested in protecting trade routes and commercial activity, recognizing that commerce generated revenue and political power. [P]

**Route Security:**

Trade route protection included:

- **Military patrols:** Soldiers protecting caravans and routes
- **Diplomacy:** Agreements with neighboring powers for safe passage
- **Infrastructure:** Wells, staging posts, and fortifications along routes

**Examples:**

- Mali under Mansa Musa was famous for route security; travelers reported being able to cross the empire safely
- Songhai maintained security along the Niger and trans-Saharan routes
- Kilwa's commercial position depended on control of the Sofala route

**Merchant Protection:**

Rulers protected merchant communities:

- Foreign merchants residing under royal protection
- Adjudication of disputes involving merchants
- Retaliation for attacks on the kingdom's merchants abroad

**Confidence Assessment:** Trade protection is [P] Probable based on multiple sources describing secure travel under strong rulers.

---

## Regional Variations

### West Africa (Sahel and Forest)

The West African economic system was characterized by the north-south exchange of gold and salt, mediated through the great Sahelian cities. [E]

**Distinctive Features:**

- **Gold as the premier export:** The trans-Saharan trade was driven by West African gold
- **Salt as critical import:** The salt-gold exchange was the foundational economic relationship
- **Cowrie currency:** Cowries were the dominant small-denomination money
- **Multiple currencies:** Gold dust, salt, cowries, cloth, and other currencies circulated
- **The Wangara:** A specialized long-distance trading community dominated the gold trade
- **Islamic commercial law:** In Islamized cities, Islamic legal frameworks governed commerce

**The Forest Zone:**

South of the Sahel, the forest zone had its own commercial characteristics:

- **Kola production:** The forest produced kola nuts that moved northward
- **Gold production:** Alluvial gold came from forest rivers
- **Different currencies:** Iron currencies were more prominent
- **Benin's economy:** Bronze-casting, royal monopolies, and Atlantic trade (post-1485)

---

### East Africa (Swahili Coast)

The Swahili Coast economy was oriented toward Indian Ocean maritime trade rather than overland commerce. [E]

**Distinctive Features:**

- **Maritime orientation:** Trade moved by sea with the monsoons
- **Seasonal rhythm:** The monsoon cycle structured commercial activity
- **Multiple currencies:** Cloth, beads, Kilwa coins, and various other media
- **Gold from the interior:** Zimbabwe Plateau gold reached Indian Ocean markets through coastal ports
- **Urban concentration:** Commerce centered in city-states (Kilwa, Mombasa, Mogadishu)
- **Cosmopolitan culture:** Indian, Arabian, and African influences mixed

**The Interior Connection:**

The coast depended on interior supplies:

- Gold from the Zimbabwe Plateau
- Ivory from across East Africa
- Enslaved people from various sources
- Agricultural products from the mainland

---

### Southern Africa (Zimbabwe Plateau)

The Zimbabwe Plateau economy was based on cattle-keeping and gold production, with trade connections to the Indian Ocean via the Swahili Coast. [P]

**Distinctive Features:**

- **Cattle as primary wealth:** Cattle were the measure of wealth and social status
- **Gold as export commodity:** Gold was mined for external trade, not for internal circulation
- **Beads as currency:** Indian Ocean glass beads served monetary functions
- **State control:** Great Zimbabwe and successor states controlled trade routes
- **Limited monetization:** The economy was less fully monetized than West or East Africa

**Trade Orientation:**

Southern African trade flowed toward the Indian Ocean:

- Gold and ivory moved to Sofala and thence to Kilwa
- Indian cloth and beads moved inland
- The route was controlled by African intermediaries

---

### Horn of Africa (Aksum/Ethiopia)

The Ethiopian highlands had the most distinctive monetary system in sub-Saharan Africa: the only indigenous coinage tradition. [E]

**Distinctive Features:**

- **Aksumite coinage:** Gold, silver, and bronze coins minted to international standards
- **Integration with the Roman/Byzantine world:** Coinage calibrated to the solidus standard
- **Christian economy:** After conversion, the church became a major economic institution
- **Post-Aksumite decline:** After Aksumite collapse, salt bars (*amole*) became the primary currency
- **Trade orientation:** Red Sea commerce connecting Africa to Arabia and beyond

**The Salt Bar Economy:**

In the medieval period after Aksumite coinage ceased:

- Rock salt bars (*amole*) from the Danakil Depression served as currency
- The bars were of standardized size
- Value decreased with distance from source (opposite to gold's pattern)

---

## For Fiction Writing

### Market Scenes

**The Great Market (West African Sahel City):**

*The market opens at dawn, while the air still holds the night's coolness. By the time the sun clears the mud-brick walls, the space is alive with commerce. In the cloth section, bolts of indigo-dyed fabric --- the famous blue of Kano's dye pits --- hang like walls of color. The salt merchants have arranged their blocks in precise stacks, each block a fortune in the forest country to the south. In a quieter corner, gold dust changes hands on delicate scales, the merchant's fingers steady as he adjusts the balance weights. Cowrie shells clink in leather pouches; bargaining voices rise and fall in a dozen languages. The market chief's men patrol the aisles, ready to intervene in disputes or check a merchant's scales. By midday the heat drives many to shade, but by afternoon the trading resumes until the muezzin's call signals evening prayer.*

**The Harbor Market (Swahili Coast):**

*The dhows arrived with the morning tide, their lateen sails furling as they dropped anchor in the harbor. Now the market surges with activity. The stalls are spread with goods from across the Indian Ocean world: Gujarat cloth in reds and blues, Chinese ceramics (the merchant unwraps each piece carefully from its straw packing), glass beads glinting in piles of amber and blue and red. Against these foreign wonders, the African goods are arrayed: ivory tusks arranged by size, bags of gold dust under careful guard, bundles of mangrove poles waiting to be loaded for Arabia. The trading is conducted in Swahili and Arabic, with occasional phrases of Gujarati or Persian. By the wall, the copper coins of Kilwa change hands --- small pieces bearing the sultan's name. A merchant pulls out a length of cloth to test the quality; another holds porcelain to the light. By evening, deals struck today will shape the cargoes departing with the next monsoon.*

---

### Bargaining and Negotiation

**The Gold Transaction:**

*The Wangara merchant produces a leather pouch, unknots the top, and pours a stream of gold dust onto the scale's bronze pan. He adds a small weight --- brass, worked into the shape of a scorpion --- and the scale's arms swing, oscillate, settle. "The weight is true," he says, speaking Mande-accented Arabic. The buyer --- a Saharan trader, his robes still dusty from the desert crossing --- peers at the scale, shifts his own weight, calculates. "The dust is good?" he asks, though they both know the question is ritual. "From Bure," the Wangara replies. "As gold comes." They negotiate: the price in mitqals of salt, the terms of payment (some now, some when the buyer returns from the north), the witnesses who will remember the deal. When agreement is reached, they clasp hands. Trust binds them more than any written contract.*

**The Cloth Transaction:**

*"This piece alone," the Indian merchant says, "is worth twenty measures." He unfolds the fabric, lets the Swahili woman feel its weave. She is unimpressed or pretends to be. "In Cambay, perhaps. Here, I can buy such cloth anywhere." They both know she cannot --- not this quality, not these dyes. But the negotiation must proceed. Numbers are exchanged, rejected, counter-offered. The merchant invokes his costs, the dangers of the voyage, the quality of his goods. The woman invokes her limited resources, the competition, the uncertain market. They circle toward agreement like dancers. Finally, a figure is named that both can accept. Beads will change hands, good Indian glass beads that will themselves become currency in the interior. The deal is struck; the cloth is folded; each party believes they have done well.*

---

### Currency Exchange

**Converting Currencies:**

*The trader arrived from the coast with a fortune in glass beads --- forty strings of the red ones, thirty of the blue, ten of the rare yellow that commanded the highest prices. But here in the highland market, beads were not what he needed. He sought a broker, a man who knew the exchange rates: how many beads for a goat, how many goats for a mitqal of gold dust, how the scales shifted with season and scarcity. The broker took his commission --- five beads from each transaction, or the equivalent --- but his knowledge was worth the price. By day's end, the trader had converted his coastal wealth into portable gold and a train of cattle, ready for the next stage of the journey. The beads had passed to a woman who would take them south, where they would buy ivory to feed the next cycle of trade.*

**The Money-Changer's Art:**

*His table was simple: a cloth spread with piles of cowrie shells, stacks of cloth strips, a balance scale, a few brass weights. But the money-changer's skill was anything but simple. He knew the exchange rates as a scholar knows his texts --- how many cowries to the cloth strip, how the rate varied with the quality of the cloth, how the Moroccan gold coin related to the mitqal of dust, how the copper manilla traded against all of these. Merchants came to him when their currencies needed conversion, when they planned journeys to regions with different monetary systems, when they needed someone who could guarantee the value of unfamiliar money. He took his percentage, but he also took the risk --- if a merchant was cheated on exchange, the money-changer's reputation suffered.*

---

### Merchant Life

**The Wangara Merchant:**

*Diallo had traveled this route for thirty years --- from the kola trees of the forest to the salt depots of Timbuktu and back again. He knew every village where a trader could find lodging, every chief who demanded tribute, every waterhole along the way. His sons traveled with him now, learning the routes and the rhythms, the languages and the customs. In each city they visited, they stayed with kin --- the network of Wangara families that stretched across West Africa, bound by blood, faith, and commerce. Islam gave them common ground with merchants from beyond the Sahara; Mande languages connected them to the gold country; commercial reputation gave them credit. When Diallo died, his sons would continue the trade, and their sons after them. The networks were the true wealth, passed from generation to generation like gold dust itself.*

**The Swahili Factor:**

*Hassan maintained his father's trading house in Kilwa, though his father had been dead these seven years. The house --- coral-stone walls, carved wooden doors, a courtyard where goods were stored --- had witnessed three generations of commerce. When the ships arrived with the monsoon, Hassan was there to meet them, to offer storage, to arrange transactions between foreign captains and local merchants. He knew everyone: which trader was reliable, which captain paid fair prices, which sultan's official demanded bribes and which was honest. His Arabic was fluent (the language of commerce), his Swahili perfect (the language of home), his Gujarati adequate (the language of cloth). He took commissions from both sides, small percentages that accumulated into comfortable wealth. His sons were learning the trade; his daughters would marry into trading families. The house would endure.*

---

### Weights and Measures

**The Goldsmith's Scales:**

*The scales were his most prized possession --- brass pans suspended from a central beam by silk threads, so sensitive they responded to a breath. The weights were kept in a carved wooden box: the full mitqal weight and its fractions, down to the tiny pieces that measured a tenth of a tenth. Each weight had been checked against the standard kept by the market chief, verified, certified. When a customer brought gold dust to be weighed, the goldsmith performed a ritual of precision: cleaning the pans, positioning the weights, watching the balance settle to absolute stillness. The weight spoken aloud was the weight that
