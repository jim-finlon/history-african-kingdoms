# CLAUDE.md - Project Instructions

## Project Identity

**Project Name:** Sub-Saharan African Kingdoms Academic Research Database
**Type:** Standalone Academic Research Project
**Purpose:** Comprehensive historical research on Sub-Saharan African kingdoms and civilizations (~300 CE - 1600 CE)

---

## Critical Instruction

**This is a STANDALONE academic research project.**

- This database is the **source of truth** for historical information about Sub-Saharan African civilizations
- Fiction projects are **consumers** of this research
- This project should **NOT reference specific fiction works, characters, or storylines**
- Maintain academic objectivity in all entries
- Include "For Fiction Writing" sections with **generic** guidance for any writer
- **Decolonizing lens:** Center African agency, indigenous perspectives, and internal dynamics. Resist narratives of "discovery," passive victimhood, or civilizational hierarchy. Africa's kingdoms were sophisticated, interconnected polities with their own intellectual, artistic, and political traditions.

---

## Content Standards

### Academic Quality
- All entries should meet academic research standards
- Cite primary and secondary sources
- Include confidence assessments for all claims
- Note scholarly debates and uncertainties
- Distinguish between historical fact, oral tradition, archaeological inference, and legend
- Acknowledge gaps in the written record without treating absence of European documentation as absence of history

### The Oral Tradition Problem
Sub-Saharan African history relies heavily on non-written sources. This project treats oral tradition with the same analytical rigor as written sources:
- **Oral epics and genealogies** (e.g., Sundiata epic, Dausi) are primary sources, not "legends"
- **Griots/djeli** (West Africa), **imbongi** (Southern Africa), and court historians were professional archivists
- Oral sources have their own biases, transmission distortions, and political functions — document these
- Cross-reference oral tradition with archaeological evidence and Arabic/European written accounts where possible

### Source Categories for This Project
1. **Arabic Chronicles:** al-Bakri, al-Idrisi, Ibn Battuta, al-Umari, Ibn Khaldun, al-Mas'udi, Leo Africanus. These are the richest written sources for West Africa and the Swahili Coast. Note: authors often relied on second-hand reports and carried their own cultural frameworks.
2. **Ethiopian Written Tradition:** Ge'ez chronicles, hagiographies (e.g., *Kebra Nagast*), royal chronicles (*Ya'arike Negast*). Literate tradition independent of Arabic/European sources.
3. **European Accounts:** Portuguese (*cronistas*), occasional Italian/Dutch travelers. Late in our period (post-1400s); heavily biased but sometimes contain unique observations.
4. **Archaeological Evidence:** Excavations at Great Zimbabwe, Kilwa, Jenne-Jeno, Igbo-Ukwu, Mapungubwe, Aksum, etc. Often the primary or only evidence for certain periods.
5. **Oral Tradition:** Sundiata epic, Dausi, royal genealogies, clan histories. Transmitted through professional historians. Invaluable but requires careful source criticism.
6. **Material Culture:** Terracotta (Nok, Ife), bronze-casting (Benin, Igbo-Ukwu), stone architecture (Zimbabwe, Aksum), coinage (Aksum, Kilwa), inscriptions (Aksum).
7. **Linguistic Evidence:** Bantu expansion reconstruction, loanwords indicating trade contacts, place-name analysis.

### "For Fiction Writing" Sections
These sections ARE appropriate as they serve any fiction writer:
- Sensory details (sight, sound, smell, taste, texture)
- Character notes (personality, voice, demeanor, cultural mannerisms)
- Scene-setting information (architecture, clothing, food, weather, landscape)
- Dialogue opportunities and speech conventions
- Period-appropriate cultural details
- Emotional landscape and worldview
- These should be **generic** guidance, not tied to specific fictional works

### Cross-Referencing
- Use Obsidian wiki-links: `[[filename]]` or `[[filename|display text]]`
- Maintain consistent linking between entries
- Index files should provide navigation
- Note connections to Islamic world, Indian Ocean network, Mediterranean, and other research projects
- Cross-reference oral traditions with archaeological confirmations

---

## Confidence Levels

Historical certainty varies enormously in this field. Use the following system:

- **[Established]:** Multiple independent sources (written + archaeological); scholarly consensus. *Example: Mansa Musa's hajj in 1324.*
- **[Probable]:** Supported by at least one reliable source and consistent with other evidence; majority scholarly view. *Example: Ghana Empire's capital at Koumbi Saleh.*
- **[Debated]:** Active scholarly disagreement with evidence on multiple sides. *Example: Exact dating of Great Zimbabwe's construction phases.*
- **[Speculative]:** Scholarly inference without direct evidence; plausible but unconfirmed. *Example: Population estimates for most cities.*
- **[Traditional/Oral]:** Drawn from oral tradition; may contain historical kernel but not independently confirmed. *Example: Many details of Sundiata's early life.*

### Special Note on Silence
Where the written record is silent, say so explicitly. Absence of documentation is not absence of activity. Many sophisticated African polities left no written records that survive, and European "first contact" narratives distort the timeline of African achievement. Frame gaps as gaps in *our knowledge*, not gaps in *African history*.

---

## Decolonizing Framework

This project operates under the following principles:

1. **African agency is the default.** African states, traders, scholars, and rulers are the protagonists. External actors (Arab traders, Portuguese explorers) appear in relation to African polities, not the reverse.
2. **No "discovery" language.** Europeans did not "discover" African kingdoms. Use "first European contact," "Portuguese arrival," or similar neutral phrasing.
3. **Internal complexity.** African societies had their own internal debates, class structures, political rivalries, intellectual traditions, and moral frameworks. Avoid flattening complexity.
4. **Comparative without hierarchical.** Comparisons to European, Asian, or Middle Eastern parallels can be useful for reader orientation but should not imply a normative standard.
5. **Name sovereignty.** Use African names and terms as primary identifiers. Provide Arabic/European equivalents in parentheses where useful.
6. **Resist exoticization.** African customs and practices should be described with the same matter-of-fact tone used for European or Asian equivalents.
7. **Acknowledge historiographic injustice.** The relative paucity of written sources for some regions reflects colonial-era destruction, European scholarly neglect, and the privileging of literate cultures — not an absence of history.

## Africa-Specific Research Notes

### The "Ghana" Problem
"Ghana" was a title (meaning "warrior king"), not the kingdom's own name for itself. The empire was centered on the Soninke people and likely called Wagadu. Similarly, "Songhai" and other names may reflect outsiders' terminology. Document these complexities.

### Dating Challenges
- Most West African dates before c. 1000 CE are approximate
- Archaeological dating (radiocarbon, thermoluminescence) provides ranges, not precise dates
- Arabic sources give more precise dates but often for events they observed indirectly
- Oral tradition preserves sequence but not absolute chronology
- Ethiopian and Nubian written records provide tighter dating for the Horn of Africa

### Population and Scale
- Population figures for African cities and states are highly speculative before the 16th century
- Archaeological evidence (settlement size, agricultural capacity) provides some basis for estimates
- Arabic travelers' estimates are often exaggerated but provide relative scale
- Mark all population figures with appropriate confidence levels

### Bias Awareness
- **Arabic sources:** Generally more sympathetic to Islamized elites; may undervalue non-Muslim achievements; interested primarily in trade and religious matters
- **European sources:** Late-arriving, culturally condescending, focused on commercial possibilities; "discovery" framing
- **Oral tradition:** Shaped by political patronage; may glorify ruling lineages at expense of others; transmission over centuries introduces changes
- **Archaeological interpretation:** Has sometimes been distorted by colonial-era racial theories (e.g., the "mystery" of Great Zimbabwe's builders)
- **Modern scholarship:** Earlier generations of Africanist historians may carry Eurocentric assumptions; prefer post-1960s scholarship that centers African perspectives
