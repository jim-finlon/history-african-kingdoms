## Overview

Niani occupies an extraordinary position in West African historiography: it is simultaneously the most famous and the most problematic capital city in the medieval Sahel. Oral tradition across the Mande-speaking world identifies Niani as the seat of Sundiata Keita, founder of the Mali Empire, and as the imperial capital where his successors held court for generations. The Sundiata epic places the founding of Mali at Niani, and the name resonates through eight centuries of griot performance as the center of Mande civilization. Yet when archaeologists excavated the site traditionally identified as Niani in the 1960s and 1970s, they found a settlement far smaller than one would expect for the capital of one of medieval history's wealthiest empires.

This paradox defines contemporary scholarly debate about Niani. Three possibilities exist: First, the archaeological site near Siguiri in modern Guinea genuinely represents Sundiata's capital, and our expectations of its size are miscalibrated---perhaps the Mali court was more modest than Arabic sources suggest, or perhaps we have not yet located the main settlement. Second, the site is correctly identified, but Niani was not the only capital: the Mali mansas may have maintained multiple royal residences, with a mobile court that moved seasonally or a different city serving as the primary administrative center during certain periods. Third, the identification is simply wrong, and the true site of Niani lies elsewhere, yet to be discovered or recognized.

What is beyond doubt is Niani's centrality to Mande identity. Whether or not the archaeological site near Siguiri captures the physical reality of Sundiata's capital, "Niani" as a concept---the place where Mali began, where the Kouroukan Fouga was promulgated, where the Keita dynasty established justice after Sosso tyranny---remains foundational to how Mande peoples understand their history. For fiction writers, this offers both challenge and opportunity: the historical uncertainty allows for imaginative reconstruction, while the oral tradition provides rich material for depicting what Mande peoples believed their capital to be.

## Geography and Environment

### Physical Setting

The site traditionally identified as Niani lies in the upper Niger basin, on the left bank of the Sankarani River (a tributary of the Niger), near its confluence with the Niger itself. The landscape is characteristic of the southern Sahel/northern savanna woodland zone: rolling terrain with scattered trees, seasonal watercourses, and soil suitable for agriculture. Elevation is approximately 350--400 meters above sea level. [P]

The Sankarani River provided the settlement with reliable water access. The river floods seasonally during the rainy season (June--October), creating fertile floodplains suitable for cultivation. Fish from the river supplemented the agricultural diet. The confluence zone with the Niger placed any settlement here at a strategic node in the regional waterway network. [P]

The terrain around the archaeological site includes:
- **Riverine areas:** Floodplains and gallery forests along the Sankarani
- **Savanna woodland:** Mixed grassland and scattered trees (baobabs, shea, acacias, and other species)
- **Rocky outcrops:** Hills and kopjes that may have served as defensive positions or sacred sites
- **Agricultural land:** Soil suitable for millet, sorghum, and (in wetter areas) rice cultivation

### Climate

The upper Niger basin experiences a tropical savanna climate with distinct wet and dry seasons:

**Wet Season (June--October):**
- Heavy monsoon rains, with July--September the peak months
- Annual rainfall approximately 1,200--1,500 mm
- Rivers swell; the Sankarani becomes a significant waterway
- Agriculture intensive during and immediately after the rains
- Humid, with temperatures moderated by cloud cover (25--32degC daily range)

**Dry Season (November--May):**
- Minimal rainfall; watercourses shrink to dry-season flows
- Harmattan winds bring Saharan dust (December--February)
- Hot and dry, especially March--May (temperatures reaching 40degC+)
- Trade and travel most feasible during cooler dry-season months

The climate would have shaped the rhythm of court life: agricultural activity concentrated in the wet season, long-distance trade and diplomacy more practical in the dry season, major festivals likely timed to the harvest or other seasonal markers.

### Strategic Position

The traditional location of Niani offered several strategic advantages:

**Waterway Access:** Position near the Sankarani-Niger confluence provided water transport connections throughout the Niger system. Goods and people could move by canoe from Niani to the Niger Bend cities (Djenne, Timbuktu, Gao) and beyond. [P]

**Gold Trade Access:** Niani lay relatively close to the goldfields of Bure (to the south) and Bambuk (to the west)---the primary sources of the gold that made Mali wealthy. Controlling this region meant controlling the northern outlets of the gold trade. [E]

**Manden Heartland:** The upper Niger basin was the Mande heartland---the home territory of the Mande-speaking peoples whose clans formed the core of Sundiata's coalition. Placing the capital here kept it among loyal populations. [T]

**Defensive Depth:** Unlike cities on the desert edge (such as Koumbi Saleh or later Timbuktu), Niani's location in the southern savanna provided distance from Saharan raiders. Attackers from the north would have to cross extensive territory before reaching it. [P]

**Agricultural Base:** The fertile Niger valley provided the agricultural surplus necessary to support a non-farming population of courtiers, craftsmen, soldiers, and dependents. [P]

### Ecological Context

The southern Sahel/northern savanna woodland zone represents a transition between the Sahara and the forest zone to the south. This ecological position had significant implications:

**Tsetse Fly Boundary:** The tsetse fly, which carries trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) fatal to horses and cattle, does not survive in the drier Sahel but is present in wetter savanna and forest zones. Niani's location was near this boundary---horses could survive there, but campaigns into the forest zone faced disease constraints. This helps explain why Mali's expansion was primarily northward and eastward rather than southward. [P]

**Kola Trade:** The kola forests of Guinea lay to the south. Kola nuts, a stimulant prized throughout the Muslim world (where alcohol was forbidden), were a major trade good. Niani's position gave it access to this southern trade. [P]

**Gold-Producing Zones:** The alluvial gold deposits of Bure and Bambuk were worked by forest-dwelling peoples who extracted gold from rivers. Mali did not directly control these goldfields but dominated the trade routes through which gold reached the trans-Saharan network. [E]

## History

### Origins and Founding

According to oral tradition, Niani was the seat of the Keita clan before Sundiata's birth---a small kingdom in the Manden region ruled by his father, Nare Maghann Konate (also called Maghan Kon Fatta). The epic describes Niani as already established, though not yet great, when Sundiata was born there. [T]

The founding of Niani as an *imperial* capital came after the Battle of Kirina (c. 1235), when Sundiata defeated Sumanguru Kante and established the Mali Empire. According to tradition, Sundiata chose to base his new empire at Niani rather than at another location. The great assembly at Kurukan Fuga, where the social order was established, took place near Niani. [T]

Whether Niani was already a significant settlement before Sundiata or grew great because of his decision to make it his capital is unclear. The oral tradition emphasizes Sundiata's transformation of Niani from a small kingdom into the seat of an empire, suggesting significant growth during and after his reign. [T]

Archaeological evidence from the site near Siguiri shows occupation beginning around the sixth century CE, with the settlement reaching its maximum extent between the thirteenth and fifteenth centuries---consistent with the traditional history but on a scale smaller than expected. [P/D]

### Growth and Development

If the traditional identification is correct, Niani grew during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries as the Mali Empire expanded. The reigns of Sundiata (c. 1235--c. 1255), his successors, and especially Mansa Musa (r. 1312--1337) would have seen the capital flourish. [T/P]

Arabic sources suggest significant development:

**Al-Umari (writing c. 1337--1349)** describes the Mali capital as a major city where the mansa held court in considerable state. However, al-Umari did not visit Mali himself; his account is based on interviews with Egyptian officials who met Mansa Musa in Cairo and with West African informants. He does not use the name "Niani." [E]

**Ibn Battuta (visiting 1352--1353)** provides the only eyewitness account of the Mali capital, which he visited under Mansa Sulayman. His account describes a functioning court with elaborate ceremonies but provides limited detail about the city itself. He does not clearly name the capital; scholars debate whether he was at Niani or elsewhere. [E/D]

The problem is that neither source provides enough geographic detail to confirm that they are describing the site near Siguiri. Al-Umari and Ibn Battuta could be describing Niani, a different capital, or possibly different places at different times.

### Peak Period

The Mali Empire reached its greatest extent under Mansa Musa (r. 1312--1337), when it controlled the trans-Saharan gold trade and stretched from the Atlantic coast to beyond Gao on the Niger Bend. If Niani was the capital during this period, it would have been at its zenith: receiving tribute from a vast empire, hosting merchants from across the Sahara, and serving as the seat of one of the wealthiest rulers in world history. [T/P]

The architectural innovations attributed to al-Sahili---the Andalusian architect Mansa Musa brought back from his hajj---are traditionally associated with Timbuktu (the Djinguereber Mosque) but also reportedly included construction at the capital. If al-Sahili built structures at Niani, they would have transformed its appearance. [T/P]

Under Mansa Sulayman (r. 1341--1360), Ibn Battuta witnessed elaborate court ceremonies including:
- Royal audiences with the mansa seated on a platform under a silk umbrella
- Performances by the *dugha* (master of ceremonies) with musicians and acrobats
- Islamic prayers and festivals observed with considerable pomp
- Petitioners approaching the ruler through elaborate protocol

Whether these ceremonies took place at Niani, at a different capital, or at a mobile court cannot be determined with certainty from Ibn Battuta's account. [E/D]

### Decline and Abandonment

Niani's decline paralleled the Mali Empire's contraction. Several factors contributed:

**Songhai Expansion (fifteenth century):** The rising Songhai state under Sunni Ali (r. 1464--1492) captured the Niger Bend cities (Timbuktu, Djenne) that had been under Mali's control, drastically reducing Mali's revenues and prestige. [E]

**Mossi Raids:** The Mossi kingdoms to the south raided Mali territory repeatedly in the fifteenth century, including (according to some sources) an attack on the capital itself. [P]

**Internal Succession Conflicts:** The Mali succession system, which did not follow strict primogeniture, generated repeated civil wars that weakened central authority. [P]

**Trade Route Shifts:** Changes in trans-Saharan trade patterns may have reduced the importance of the upper Niger region relative to areas further east. [S]

By the sixteenth century, Mali had contracted to a shadow of its former extent. The capital (whether Niani or elsewhere) would have declined correspondingly. Leo Africanus (writing c. 1526) describes Mali as much reduced but still existing; he mentions the kingdom without providing clear detail about its capital. [P]

### Later History

The archaeological site near Siguiri shows declining occupation after the fifteenth century, consistent with Mali's political decline. The exact end of occupation is unclear, but by the colonial period, the site was remembered as a historic location rather than a functioning city. [P]

The *memory* of Niani persisted, however, transmitted by griots across the Mande world. The name remained central to the Sundiata epic and to Mande identity, even as the physical city faded.

Modern interest in the site emerged during the colonial and post-colonial periods:
- French colonial administrators and scholars identified the site in the early twentieth century
- Polish archaeologist W. Filipowiak conducted excavations in the 1960s and 1970s
- The Republic of Mali (founded 1960) took its name from the medieval empire, reinforcing interest in Niani as a heritage site
- Scholarly debate about the site's identification intensified from the 1970s onward

## Urban Layout and Architecture

### What the Sources Suggest

The Arabic sources and oral tradition provide hints about what the Mali capital looked like, though these cannot be definitively linked to the specific site near Siguiri.

**Dual-City Pattern:** Al-Bakri's description of the Ghana Empire capital (Koumbi Saleh) mentions a dual-city structure: a Muslim traders' quarter and a royal quarter separated by some distance. Some scholars have suggested Mali's capital may have followed a similar pattern, which could explain why excavations found a modest settlement---perhaps the excavated area was only one portion of a larger urban complex. [S]

**Royal Compound:** Ibn Battuta describes the mansa's audience hall and court, implying a substantial royal compound with spaces for public audiences, private quarters, and court activities. The mansa sat on a raised platform (*bembe*) under a silk umbrella topped with a golden bird. [E]

**Mosque:** Mali's rulers from Sundiata onward are portrayed as Muslims (with varying degrees of orthodoxy). A mosque for royal prayers would have been expected at the capital. Whether this was a grand structure (like the mosques of Timbuktu) or more modest is unknown. [P]

**Markets:** Any imperial capital would have included market areas for local trade and for accommodating merchants traveling the trans-Saharan routes. [P]

### Archaeological Evidence

W. Filipowiak's excavations at the site near Siguiri revealed:

**Settlement Area:** The excavated site covers approximately 40--50 hectares---substantial for a local settlement but modest for an imperial capital. (For comparison, Jenne-Jeno at its peak covered about 33 hectares with a surrounding hinterland of settlement clusters totaling much more, and medieval Timbuktu was considerably larger.) [D]

**Architecture:** Mud-brick construction typical of the Sahel. The excavations found remains of rectangular buildings but no grand structures clearly identifiable as palaces or major public buildings. [P]

**Artifacts:** Pottery, iron implements, and some imported goods (glass beads, copper) consistent with a trading community. The assemblage suggests a settlement engaged in local and regional trade but not the vast wealth described in Arabic sources. [P]

**Dating:** Radiocarbon dates and ceramic analysis suggest occupation from approximately the sixth century through the fifteenth century, with maximum occupation during the thirteenth--fifteenth centuries. [P]

### The Problem of Scale

The discrepancy between textual descriptions of Mali's wealth and the modest scale of the excavated site has generated several explanatory hypotheses:

**Incomplete Excavation:** Only a portion of the site has been excavated. The main royal compound, markets, or elite residential areas may lie elsewhere, yet to be discovered. Further excavation might reveal more substantial remains. [S]

**Perishable Architecture:** Much of the architecture may have been built of perishable materials (wood, thatch, textiles) that left little archaeological trace. The elaborate court described by Ibn Battuta could have existed within structures that did not survive archaeologically. [S]

**Mobile Court:** The Mali mansas may have practiced seasonal movement, with the court relocating according to political, economic, or ceremonial needs. What we call "Niani" might have been one of several royal residences, not a permanent capital in the European sense. [D]

**Wrong Site:** The archaeological site near Siguiri may not be the Niani of oral tradition. The true site lies elsewhere, misidentified or undiscovered. [D]

### Water Management

Any substantial settlement in this environment required water management:
- The Sankarani River provided primary water access
- Wells may have supplemented river water, especially in the dry season
- No evidence of sophisticated irrigation systems has been found at the site, suggesting reliance on rain-fed agriculture and the river [P]

### Fortifications

The excavations did not reveal substantial fortifications at the site. This contrasts with some other Sahelian cities (like Koumbi Saleh or later Hausa cities) that had walls. Possible explanations:
- Walls existed but in areas not yet excavated
- Walls were built of materials that did not survive
- The capital relied on its geographic depth (distance from threats) rather than walls
- The site is not the capital, and the actual capital was fortified [D]

## Economy and Trade

### Economic Base

**Agriculture:** The upper Niger basin supported mixed agriculture. Primary crops likely included:
- Millet and sorghum (staple grains)
- Rice (in wetter areas near rivers)
- Vegetables and legumes
- Shea trees (for shea butter, a cooking oil and cosmetic)

**Animal Husbandry:** Cattle, goats, and sheep were kept, though the tsetse fly limited cattle-keeping in wetter zones. Horses, essential for warfare and prestige, were kept but required careful management. [P]

**Fishing:** The Sankarani and Niger rivers provided fish, an important protein source. [P]

**Hunting:** The savanna supported game, and hunting was both an economic activity and a prestigious pursuit with spiritual dimensions. Sundiata himself is portrayed in oral tradition as connected to hunter culture. [T]

### Trade Connections

Niani's location (if correctly identified) placed it at the southern end of the trans-Saharan trade network:

**Gold Trade:** The most important trade connection. Gold from the Bambuk and Bure fields moved north through Mali-controlled territory, exchanged for salt, copper, textiles, and other goods. Mali's wealth rested on controlling this trade flow, not on directly mining gold. [E]

**Salt Trade:** Salt blocks from the Saharan mines (Taghaza, and later Taoudeni) traveled south, increasing enormously in value. At the Mali capital, Saharan salt met the goods of the savanna and forest. [E]

**Kola Nuts:** The kola forests to the south produced kola nuts, prized as a stimulant throughout the Muslim world. Niani's position gave access to this trade. [P]

**Slaves:** The Mali Empire, like other Sahelian states, participated in slave trading. War captives and persons enslaved through various mechanisms moved through the trading system, some transported north across the Sahara. [P]

**Copper and Textiles:** Copper from the Saharan mines and textiles from North Africa and beyond reached the Mali capital as trade goods. [P]

### Markets and Commerce

Any capital of Mali's scale would have required extensive market facilities:
- Accommodation for traveling merchants
- Space for the exchange of goods
- Systems for measuring, weighing, and valuing trade goods
- Enforcement of commercial agreements

The excavations have not clearly identified market areas, but their existence is inferred from the settlement's participation in long-distance trade. [S]

Arabic sources mention the use of gold dust as currency in Mali. The mansa reportedly monopolized gold nuggets, allowing only gold dust to circulate---a form of monetary control that maintained gold's value. [E]

### Production and Craft

**Ironworking:** The *numu* (blacksmith) caste was central to Mande society, producing tools, weapons, and prestige objects. Ironworking residue (slag, furnace remains) is common at Sahelian archaeological sites, though the excavations at the Niani site did not reveal major ironworking facilities. [P]

**Weaving:** Hand-woven cotton textiles were produced locally. Strip-woven cloth was a valuable commodity. [P]

**Leatherworking:** Another *nyamakala* craft, producing bags, sandals, armor, and other goods. [P]

**Goldworking:** Gold was worked into jewelry and prestige objects. Mali's goldsmiths were renowned, though most of the gold was exported as dust or nuggets rather than worked locally. [P]

---

## Society and Culture

### Population

Population estimates for Niani are highly speculative:

**Archaeological Evidence:** The excavated site's modest size suggests a settlement of perhaps a few thousand people---far smaller than one would expect for an imperial capital. This could mean the site is not the capital, that most of the settlement has not been found, or that the Mali court was smaller than Arabic descriptions suggest. [D]

**Textual Evidence:** Al-Umari and Ibn Battuta describe an elaborate court but do not provide population estimates. The implication is of a substantial settlement, but "substantial" is relative. [P]

**Comparative Context:** Contemporary European capitals (Paris, London) had populations of tens of thousands to over 100,000 by the fourteenth century. Great cities of the Islamic world (Cairo, Baghdad, Fez) were comparable or larger. Did Mali's capital match these scales? The archaeological evidence does not support it, but the textual evidence is ambiguous. [D]

**For Fiction Writers:** The uncertainty permits a range of interpretations. A fiction writer might depict Niani as a modest but symbolically central settlement, as a larger city whose remains have not survived, or as one of several royal seats in a mobile court system.

### Social Organization

Mande society at Niani (and throughout the empire) was organized into three broad categories:

**Horon (Freeborn Nobility):**
- The ruling Keita clan and allied clans
- Warrior lineages
- Property-owning farmers
- The political and military elite

***Nyamakala* (Occupational Castes):**
- *Numu* (blacksmiths): Masters of iron and fire; wielders of *nyama*; feared and respected
- *Djeli* (griots): Professional historians, musicians, praise-singers; keepers of genealogy and tradition
- *Garanke* (leatherworkers): Producers of leather goods; sometimes conflated with other craft groups
- Other specialized occupations

***Jon* (Servile Groups):**
- War captives and their descendants
- Persons enslaved through debt, judicial process, or other mechanisms
- Status could be hereditary but also sometimes transcended

These categories were established, according to tradition, at the assembly of Kurukan Fuga following the Battle of Kirina. The system was hierarchical but functional, with each category having defined roles and protections. [T]

### Religious Life

**Indigenous Mande Religion:** The spiritual framework of Mande society centered on *nyama* (life force, spiritual energy), ancestor veneration, and the powers associated with particular lineages and occupations. Hunters and blacksmiths were particularly associated with spiritual power. Sacred groves, shrines, and rituals maintained relationships with spiritual forces. [T]

**Islam:** Mali's rulers from Sundiata onward had some relationship with Islam, though the nature and extent of their piety is debated. By the fourteenth century, the mansas observed Islamic practices: prayers, festivals, the hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca). Mosques existed at the capital and other cities. Muslim scholars and merchants were welcomed and honored. [E]

**Coexistence:** Ibn Battuta's account makes clear that Islamic and indigenous practices coexisted at the Mali court. He was scandalized by various non-Islamic practices (unveiled women, ritual nakedness, the dust-sprinkling gesture) that were clearly acceptable within Mande culture. The Mali rulers navigated between Islamic expectations (important for trans-Saharan trade and international prestige) and indigenous traditions (essential for legitimacy among their own people). [E]

### Intellectual Life

**Griot Tradition:** The *djeli* maintained the oral archives of Mande civilization: genealogies, histories, praise-poetry, and the epics that encoded cultural values. The Sundiata epic was transmitted by griots, and the griot tradition was centered at and around the royal court. [T]

**Islamic Learning:** Under Mansa Musa and his successors, Islamic scholarship was encouraged. Scholars were invited to Mali, books were acquired, and mosques served as centers of teaching. The scholarly tradition that flourished at Timbuktu (Mali's most famous intellectual center) had roots in this period, though Timbuktu's greatest development came later under Songhai. [P]

**At the Capital:** The Mali capital would have been a center of court culture---griot performances, religious observance, diplomatic exchanges---rather than the scholarly tradition that developed at Timbuktu. The mansa's court was a political and ceremonial center first, an intellectual center second. [P]

## Archaeological Evidence

### Excavation History

**Early Identification:** French colonial administrators and scholars identified the site near Siguiri as the probable location of Niani in the early twentieth century, based on oral tradition, geographic reasoning, and surface remains. [P]

**Filipowiak Excavations (1960s--1970s):** Polish archaeologist Wladyslaw Filipowiak conducted the most extensive excavations at the site, working under the auspices of Polish-Guinean cooperation. His excavations established the site's chronology and revealed the modest scale that has generated scholarly debate. [E]

**Publication:** Filipowiak published his findings in Polish and French, documenting the stratigraphy, architecture, and artifacts recovered. His work remains the primary archaeological reference for the site. [E]

**Subsequent Work:** Limited further excavation has been conducted. The site has received less archaeological attention than some other West African sites (Jenne-Jeno, Great Zimbabwe), partly due to Guinea's political circumstances and partly due to the site's ambiguous status. [P]

### Key Findings

**Settlement Pattern:** A moderately sized settlement with mud-brick architecture, occupied from roughly the sixth through fifteenth centuries CE. The settlement reached maximum extent during the thirteenth--fifteenth centuries. [P]

**Architecture:** Rectangular mud-brick buildings, some with multiple rooms. No clearly identified palatial or monumental structures. Construction techniques consistent with Sahelian norms. [P]

**Artifacts:**
- Local pottery in forms consistent with Mande ceramic traditions
- Iron tools and weapons
- Imported goods: glass beads, copper objects, occasional items indicating long-distance trade
- No spectacular finds (no gold hoards, no royal regalia, no elaborate art objects)

**Burials:** Cemetery areas with burials consistent with local traditions. Some evidence of Islamic burial practice (orientation toward Mecca) alongside traditional practices. [P]

### Dating

The chronology relies on:
- Radiocarbon dating of organic materials
- Ceramic typology (comparing pottery styles to dated sequences from other sites)
- Stratigraphic analysis (determining relative dating from layer sequence)

The dates indicate occupation from approximately the sixth century CE, with the main period of occupation in the thirteenth--fifteenth centuries, and decline thereafter. This is consistent with the traditional history of Mali but does not prove that this specific site was the imperial capital. [P]

### Current Interpretation

Contemporary scholars hold various views:

**Traditional Identification Supporters:** The site near Siguiri is Sundiata's Niani, but our understanding of what the Mali capital looked like needs adjustment. We should not expect a large city in the Mediterranean or Middle Eastern mold; the Mali court may have been more modest, more spread out, or more reliant on perishable architecture than we assume. [D]

**Mobile Court Theorists:** "Niani" was one of several royal residences, and the Mali mansas practiced a mobile or seasonal court system common in other African kingdoms. The modest site is what we would expect for one residence among several. [D]

**Alternative Location Theorists:** The site near Siguiri is a significant settlement but not the Mali capital. The true Niani lies elsewhere---perhaps further along the Niger, perhaps at a site not yet identified. [D]

**Ibn Battuta Question:** Some scholars argue that Ibn Battuta did not visit the site near Siguiri at all. His capital visit may have been to a different location, possibly further up the Niger. His geographic descriptions are too vague to resolve the question. [D]

### Gaps and Controversies

**The Scale Problem:** The fundamental controversy is the mismatch between textual descriptions of Mali's wealth and the modest archaeological remains. No proposed solution has achieved scholarly consensus.

**Chronological Questions:** Whether the excavated remains date primarily from before, during, or after Mali's peak period affects interpretation. If the main occupation was earlier than the empire's height, this might not be the imperial capital.

**Comparisons:** The site has not been systematically compared with other Sahelian urban sites (Jenne-Jeno, Gao, Koumbi Saleh) in a way that would clarify its relative scale and importance.

**Future Research:** More extensive excavation, geophysical survey, and comparison with other sites could potentially resolve the debate. Such research has not been prioritized.

## Scholarly Debates

| Question | Position A | Position B | Current Consensus |
|----------|------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Is the Siguiri site Niani?** | Yes, supported by oral tradition and geographic reasoning | Uncertain or unlikely; archaeological evidence insufficient | [D] Debated; traditional identification widely cited but questioned |
| **Was Niani Mali's only capital?** | Yes, the primary seat of the mansas | No, there were multiple capitals or a mobile court | [D] Multiple capitals/mobile court increasingly favored |
| **Where was Ibn Battuta's capital?** | At the Siguiri site | Elsewhere, perhaps further north or on the Niger proper | [D] Actively debated; insufficient geographic detail to determine |
| **What explains the site's modest scale?** | Incomplete excavation; perishable architecture; different urbanism model | Wrong site identification | [D] Multiple explanations proposed; none definitive |
| **When did Niani decline?** | Fifteenth century, with Mali's political decline | Earlier, with the capital moving elsewhere | [P] Fifteenth century decline generally accepted for the site |

### Alternative Capital Theories

Several alternatives to the traditional Niani identification have been proposed:

**Different Niger Location:** Some scholars suggest the capital was located further downstream on the Niger proper, closer to the Niger Bend cities, where trade advantages would have been greater.

**Mobile Court:** Rather than a single fixed capital, Mali may have had a mobile court that moved seasonally or according to political circumstances---a pattern documented in other African kingdoms.

**Multiple Capitals:** Different mansas may have maintained different capitals, with "Niani" being the traditional seat of the Keita lineage but not necessarily the administrative center.

**Niani as Symbolic, Not Physical:** "Niani" may be a concept---the legitimating center of Mali power---rather than a specific physical location. The name may have been attached to wherever the mansa held court.

None of these alternatives has definitive evidence, and the traditional identification continues to be widely cited despite its problems.

## For Fiction Writing

### The Gift of Uncertainty

Niani's contested archaeology presents fiction writers with a remarkable opportunity. The oral tradition provides rich material for imagining the capital of Mali---the court of Sundiata, the ceremonies of Mansa Musa's era, the palace intrigues of Mansa Sulayman's time---while the scholarly uncertainty permits creative interpretation without contradicting established facts. A fiction writer can construct a Niani consistent with the tradition without being bound by the modest archaeological remains.

### Sensory World

#### Sight

**The Approach:**
A traveler approaching Niani from the north (from the desert and Sahel) would have journeyed through increasingly green landscape as they moved into the savanna zone:
- The brown of dry-season grass giving way to greener vegetation
- Scattered baobabs, their massive trunks unmistakable silhouettes
- The gleam of the Sankarani River through gallery forest
- Smoke rising from settlement cooking fires
- If walls existed, their mud-brick lines on the horizon
- The royal compound perhaps distinguishable by size, flags, or symbols

**Within the Settlement:**
- Mud-brick buildings, some rectangular, some possibly round, with flat or slightly domed roofs
- Narrow streets shaded by eaves and trees
- Market areas crowded with goods: salt slabs, cloth bales, leather goods, pottery, food
- The mansa's compound: larger buildings, perhaps whitewashed or decorated, the umbrella with the golden bird marking the royal presence
- Bright cotton cloths: indigo blue, white, patterns
- Gold ornaments on elite figures: earrings, bracelets, the gleam of gold dust

**The Court:**
Ibn Battuta provides the visual vocabulary:
- The mansa seated on a raised platform (*bembe*) under a silk umbrella topped with a golden bird
- Silk cushions
- Attendants bearing gold and silver standards, swords, spears
- The mansa in red velvet or fine cotton, wearing a golden skullcap
- Women in elaborate dress with gold and silver headbands
- Petitioners in deliberately humble clothing, sprinkling dust on their heads

**Colors:**
- The earth tones of mud brick: brown, ochre, clay red
- The green of vegetation (wet season) or gold-brown of dry grass
- Indigo blue of dyed cloth
- White of undyed cotton
- Red of imported velvet and local dyes
- The yellow gleam of gold
- The blue of the Sahelian sky (or the haze of harmattan dust)

#### Sound

**The Soundscape of Daily Life:**
- Griot performances: the *balafon* (wooden xylophone) with its bright, clear tones; the *kora* (if it existed in this period) with its shimmering arpeggios; drums carrying rhythms across the settlement
- Praise-singing: the griot's voice reciting genealogies, celebrating the mansa, preserving history
- Market sounds: haggling voices, braying donkeys, the thump of grain being pounded in mortars
- The call to prayer from the mosque (if the Muslim quarter had a muezzin)
- Children playing, women's conversations, the rhythm of daily work
- Animals: goats bleating, cattle lowing (in the morning and evening), horses stamping
- The river: the lap of water, the splash of fishermen's nets, the calls of riverboats

**Court Sounds:**
- The *dugha* and his musicians: the elaborate performances Ibn Battuta describes

### Arrival Scene

**From the North (the Desert Road):**
A traveler from across the Sahara, having survived the desert crossing, approaches Niani through increasingly hospitable landscape. The dry Sahel gives way to greener savanna. The river appears---a miracle of water after the desert. The settlement rises from the landscape: at first just smoke, then walls or buildings visible, then the bustle of a living city. The relief of arrival after weeks of dangerous travel.

**From the South (the Gold Country):**
A merchant or messenger coming from the goldfields approaches through denser vegetation, crossing the Sankarani or its tributaries. The capital represents the northern limit of their world, the place where the forest's gold meets the desert's salt, where local power engages with the wider Islamic world.

**From the East or West:**
Travelers from other parts of Mali's vast empire approach through savanna and floodplain, perhaps by canoe on the Niger system, arriving at the seat of the power that governs their distant homes.

### Key Locations Within

**The Mansa's Compound:**
The heart of Niani would be the royal compound---larger, more elaborate, more densely guarded than any other space. Within it:
- The audience hall where the mansa sits on his *bembe*
- Private quarters for the mansa and his wives
- Spaces for the royal children
- Quarters for immediate servants and guards
- Storage for royal treasures
- The royal mosque (if separate from the public mosque)

**The Market:**
A major trading city would have extensive market facilities:
- Areas for different goods (salt, cloth, gold, slaves, food)
- Accommodation for traveling merchants
- Spaces for weighing, measuring, valuing goods
- Dispute resolution by market authorities

**The Mosque:**
A structure for Muslim prayers, probably modest by later Sudanic standards but significant:
- Mud-brick construction, possibly with a minaret
- A courtyard for congregational prayers
- Perhaps a school attached

**The Griot Quarter:**
If griots had a specific residential area:
- Housing for griot families
- Spaces for rehearsal and performance
- Storage for instruments and oral archives (the griots' memories)

**The River:**
The Sankarani would have its own zones:
- Fishing areas
- Canoe landings
- Water-fetching points
- Perhaps ritual sites (rivers have spiritual significance)

**Craft Quarters:**
Blacksmiths, weavers, leatherworkers might have had specific neighborhoods:
- Workshops with forges, looms, tanning pits
- Storage for raw materials and finished goods
- The smoke and sounds of craft production

### Seasonal Variations

**Dry Season (November-May):**
- Trade season: caravans arriving from across the Sahara
- Diplomatic season: embassies and visitors
- Military campaigns (if any) more practical
- Dusty, hot, water precious
- The landscape brown and gold
- Harmattan haze filtering the light

**Wet Season (June-October):**
- Agricultural intensity: planting, tending, harvesting
- Rivers full, canoe travel easier
- Caravans pause; trans-Saharan travel dangerous
- Green and lush landscape
- Cooler, more humid
- Thunderstorms, dramatic skies

**Festival Times:**
- Islamic festivals ('Id al-Adha, 'Id al-Fitr): major court ceremonies
- Harvest celebrations
- Royal events: successions, weddings, births
- The court at its most elaborate during major festivals

### Night

**Lighting:**
- Fire: torches, oil lamps, cooking fires
- Moonlight (significant for visibility)
- Stars: spectacular in the Sahelian sky without light pollution

**Activities:**
- Griot performances continuing by firelight
- Guards patrolling
- Secret conversations: political plotting, lovers meeting
- Prayers: the night prayers for devout Muslims
- The mansa's private life, away from the public eye

**Dangers:**
- Fire: always a risk in settlements with thatched roofs
- Wild animals: hyenas, occasionally lions, at the settlement edges
- Human predators: thieves, assassins (rare but feared)
- Spiritual dangers: the night as the time of spirits and sorcery

### The Mystery Element

The uncertainty about Niani's identification permits a fiction writer to incorporate the mystery itself:
- A character might wonder at the gap between the capital's fame and its physical reality
- Stories about other royal residences, other potential capitals
- The sense that "Niani" is as much an idea as a place
- The possibility that the true palace lies hidden, protected by magic or geography

## Sources

### Primary Sources

**Ibn Battuta, *Rihla* (1354):**
The only eyewitness account of the Mali capital, describing Mansa Sulayman's court in 1352-1353. Ibn Battuta provides elaborate detail about court ceremonies but frustratingly little geographic information that would confirm he was at the site near Siguiri. His descriptions of the *dugha's* performances, the royal audiences, and court protocol are invaluable regardless of exact location.
- Translations: H.A.R. Gibb, *The Travels of Ibn Battuta* (Hakluyt Society); Levtzion & Hopkins, *Corpus of Early Arabic Sources for West African History*
- **Reliability: HIGH for court life** [E]; **UNCERTAIN for location identification** [D]

**Al-Umari, *Masalik al-Absar* (c. 1337-1349):**
Egyptian scholar who interviewed eyewitnesses to Mansa Musa's 1324 hajj. Provides information about Mali's wealth and governance but does not name the capital or provide enough geographic detail for identification.
- Translation: Levtzion & Hopkins, *Corpus*
- **Reliability: HIGH for Mali generally** [E]; **does not address location** [N/A]

**Leo Africanus, *Description of Africa* (1526):**
Writes about Mali in decline, mentioning the kingdom but providing limited detail about the capital.
- Translation: John Pory (1600); context in Natalie Zemon Davis, *Trickster Travels*
- **Reliability: MEDIUM** [P]; limited detail for this topic

**Oral Tradition (Sundiata Epic):**
The griot tradition consistently identifies Niani as Sundiata's capital and the seat of the Mali Empire. Key recorded versions:
- D.T. Niane, *Sundiata: An Epic of Old Mali* (1960; English trans. 1965)
- David C. Conrad, *Sunjata: A West African Epic of the Mande Peoples* (2004)
- **Reliability: HIGH as cultural tradition** [T]; **location identification traditional, not confirmed** [T/D]

### Secondary Sources

**Levtzion, Nehemia, *Ancient Ghana and Mali* (1973):**
The standard scholarly treatment of the Sahel empires. Levtzion accepts the traditional Niani identification while noting uncertainties.
- **Reliability: HIGH**; essential reference

**Filipowiak, Wladyslaw:**
Polish archaeologist who conducted the primary excavations at the site near Siguiri. Published in Polish and French, including:
- *Etudes archeologiques sur la capitale medievale du Mali* (1979)
- Various articles in archaeological journals
- **Reliability: HIGH for excavation data**; interpretation debated

**Conrad, David C., "A Town Called Dakajalan: The Sunjata Tradition and the Question of Ancient Mali's Capital," *Journal of African History* (1994):**
Important scholarly article questioning the Niani identification and proposing alternative interpretations.
- **Reliability: HIGH**; influential scholarly contribution to the debate

**Gomez, Michael A., *African Dominion: A New History of Empire in Early and Medieval West Africa* (2018):**
Most recent major synthesis. Discusses the Niani question with appropriate caution.
- **Reliability: HIGH**; current scholarly perspective

**McIntosh, Roderick J., *Ancient Middle Niger: Urbanism and the Self-Organizing Landscape* (2005):**
Important for understanding Sahelian urbanism patterns that might contextualize Niani's modest scale.
- **Reliability: HIGH**; useful comparative framework

### Archaeological Reports

**Filipowiak's Excavations:**
The primary archaeological documentation remains Filipowiak's publications from the 1960s-1970s. These established the site's chronology and the modest scale that has generated debate.

**Limitations:**
- Excavations covered only a portion of the site
- Publication primarily in Polish and French, limiting accessibility
- Methodology reflects the standards of the time
- No recent comprehensive re-excavation
