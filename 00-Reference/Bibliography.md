## Source Criticism

### Using Sources for This Project

| Source Type | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|-------------|-----------|------------|
| **Arabic chronicles** | Detailed; dated; named individuals | Focused on Muslim elites; secondhand reports; cultural bias |
| **Ethiopian Ge'ez texts** | Independent written tradition; court records | Royal propaganda; religious framing; limited geographic scope |
| **European accounts** | Eyewitness detail post-1400 | Late arrival; "discovery" framing; commercial/religious agendas |
| **Oral tradition** | African perspective; cultural depth; narrative richness | Transmission changes; political patronage bias; dating imprecise |
| **Archaeological evidence** | Material proof; independent of textual bias | Interpretation debated; dating ranges broad; silent on names/events |
| **Linguistic evidence** | Migration patterns; contact history | Indirect; dating approximate; requires specialist knowledge |

### Key Cautions

1. **Numbers:** Arabic and European sources routinely exaggerate army sizes, city populations, and wealth
2. **Bias:** Arabic sources privilege Muslim societies; European sources assume European norms; oral traditions serve political patrons
3. **Colonial-era scholarship:** Pre-1960 scholarship on Africa often contains racist assumptions — use with extreme caution
4. **The "Great Zimbabwe" problem:** Colonial-era refusal to accept African authorship of Great Zimbabwe exemplifies the distortions that can enter the scholarly record
5. **Dating:** Cross-reference archaeological dates with textual dates where possible; note confidence levels
6. **Silence:** Absence of written evidence does not mean absence of history or achievement
