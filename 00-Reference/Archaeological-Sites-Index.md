## Significance of Archaeology for This Project

For much of Sub-Saharan Africa, archaeology provides the only material evidence for entire centuries. Where written sources (Arabic, Ge'ez, European) are thin or absent, excavated sites, material culture, and radiocarbon dating are the foundation of historical reconstruction.

Archaeological interpretation has its own history of bias — particularly the colonial-era refusal to credit African peoples with building sophisticated structures (the "Great Zimbabwe controversy" being the most notorious example). This index uses post-colonial scholarship and prioritizes interpretations by African and Africanist archaeologists.

## West Africa

### Jenne-Jeno (Djenné-Jeno)

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Location** | Inland Niger Delta, Mali (near modern Djenné) |
| **Period** | c. 250 BCE - 1400 CE |
| **Type** | Urban settlement |
| **Excavated By** | Roderick and Susan McIntosh (1977, 1981, 1994) |
| **Significance** | One of the oldest known cities in Sub-Saharan Africa. Demonstrates that complex urbanism in West Africa developed independently, without outside influence. At its peak (c. 800-1000 CE), the settlement complex covered ~33 hectares with an estimated population of 20,000+ [Speculative]. |
| **Key Findings** | Iron-smelting from early centuries CE; terracotta figures; evidence of long-distance trade (copper, gold, stone); clustered settlement pattern suggesting "heterarchical" (non-hierarchical) urbanism |
| **Dating Method** | Radiocarbon |
| **Current Status** | UNESCO World Heritage Site (part of the "Old Towns of Djenné") |
| **Key Publication** | McIntosh, R.J. *Ancient Middle Niger* (2005); McIntosh, S.K. *Excavations at Jenne-Jeno* (1995) |
| **Confidence** | [Established] for dates and urban character; [Debated] for population estimates and political organization |

### Koumbi Saleh

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Location** | Southeastern Mauritania |
| **Period** | c. 300-1200 CE |
| **Type** | Urban settlement (probable Ghana Empire capital) |
| **Excavated By** | Thomassey and Mauny (1914, 1949-50); Berthier (1975-76); more recently Togola |
| **Significance** | Most widely identified as the capital of the Ghana Empire described by al-Bakri (1068). If correct, this was one of the largest cities in the medieval western Sahel. Al-Bakri describes a dual-city layout: a Muslim trading quarter and a royal town several miles apart. |
| **Key Findings** | Stone buildings (unusual for the region), mosque remains, evidence of trans-Saharan trade goods, cemetery with Islamic burials |
| **Dating Method** | Archaeological stratigraphy, Arabic source correlation |
| **Current Status** | Partially excavated; identification as Ghana's capital is [Probable] but not certain |
| **Key Publication** | Mauny, R. various publications; Levtzion, *Ancient Ghana and Mali* |
| **Confidence** | [Probable] — most scholars accept the identification but it is not definitively proven |

### Igbo-Ukwu

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Location** | Southeastern Nigeria (Igbo territory) |
| **Period** | c. 9th century CE |
| **Type** | Burial site and storehouse |
| **Excavated By** | Thurstan Shaw (1959-60, 1964) |
| **Significance** | Revealed sophisticated bronze-casting (lost-wax technique) and extensive long-distance trade connections centuries before European contact. The site contained over 100,000 glass and carnelian beads (originating from India or the Middle East), demonstrating that the Igbo region was connected to trans-Saharan and possibly Indian Ocean trade networks by the 9th century. |
| **Key Findings** | Elaborate bronze castings (altar vessels, staff, fly-whisk handle); massive bead collections; burial of a high-status individual with regalia |
| **Dating Method** | Radiocarbon (calibrated to c. 9th century CE) |
| **Current Status** | Items in Nigerian National Museum. Site itself not a major tourist destination. |
| **Key Publication** | Shaw, T. *Igbo-Ukwu* (1970) |
| **Confidence** | [Established] for material culture and dating; [Debated] for the political organization and identity of the buried individual |

### Nok

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Location** | Central Nigeria (Jos Plateau region) |
| **Period** | c. 1500 BCE - 500 CE |
| **Type** | Terracotta sculpture culture |
| **Excavated By** | Bernard Fagg (1940s-60s); recent work by Peter Breunig (University of Frankfurt, 2000s+) |
| **Significance** | The earliest known terracotta sculpture tradition in Sub-Saharan Africa. Nok terracottas are sophisticated, stylized human and animal figures. Also provides early evidence of iron-smelting in West Africa. Precedes and may have influenced later Yoruba (Ife) artistic traditions. |
| **Key Findings** | Hundreds of terracotta sculptures; evidence of early iron-smelting; agricultural settlement |
| **Dating Method** | Thermoluminescence and radiocarbon |
| **Current Status** | Many pieces looted and dispersed internationally. Active archaeological research continues. |
| **Key Publication** | Fagg, B. *Nok Terracottas* (1977); Breunig, P. *Nok: African Sculpture in Archaeological Context* (2014) |
| **Confidence** | [Established] for artistic tradition and dating; [Speculative] for social and political organization |

### Ife (Ile-Ife)

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Location** | Southwestern Nigeria (Yoruba heartland) |
| **Period** | c. 800-1400 CE (artistic peak c. 1100-1400) |
| **Type** | Sacred city and artistic center |
| **Excavated By** | Leo Frobenius (1910 — controversially); Frank Willett (1957-62); Babatunde Lawal and others |
| **Significance** | Produced some of the most accomplished portrait sculpture in world art history: naturalistic bronze and terracotta heads that stunned European scholars who initially refused to believe they were African. Ife is the sacred origin city of Yoruba civilization according to tradition. |
| **Key Findings** | Naturalistic bronze heads (including the famous "Olokun head"); terracotta sculptures; glass bead production; urban pavement system; evidence of divine kingship |
| **Dating Method** | Radiocarbon, thermoluminescence |
| **Current Status** | UNESCO Tentative List. Sacred groves and some archaeological areas preserved. |
| **Key Publication** | Willett, F. *Ife in the History of West African Sculpture* (1967); Drewal, H.J. & Schildkrout, E. *Dynasty and Divinity: Ife Art* (2009) |

### Benin City

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Location** | Edo State, Nigeria |
| **Period** | c. 1180-present (peak c. 1440-1600+) |
| **Type** | Walled urban center, royal capital |
| **Excavated By** | Graham Connah (1963-64); Patrick Darling (walls survey, 1990s) |
| **Significance** | One of the largest pre-modern cities in the world. The Benin city walls (earthen ramparts and ditches) extend over 16,000 km in aggregate — the largest earthwork complex anywhere in the world. The royal palace compound alone covered a vast area. The Benin Bronzes (actually brass) — over a thousand plaques, heads, and figures — were looted by the British in 1897. |
| **Key Findings** | Massive earthwork wall system; evidence of sophisticated urban planning; bronze-casting workshops; palace architecture |
| **Dating Method** | Radiocarbon, oral tradition, European accounts (post-1485) |
| **Current Status** | Modern Benin City overlays much of the ancient site. Walls partially preserved. Major repatriation campaign for looted Benin Bronzes ongoing. |
| **Key Publication** | Connah, G. *The Archaeology of Benin* (1975); Darling, P. *Archaeology and History in Southern Nigeria* (1998); Ben-Amos, P. *The Art of Benin* (1995) |

| **Location** | Island off the southern coast of Tanzania |
| **Period** | c. 800-1600 CE (peak c. 1200-1500) |
| **Type** | Swahili Coast city-state |
| **Excavated By** | H. Neville Chittick (1958-65); more recently, Stephanie Wynne-Jones and others |
| **Significance** | The most powerful and wealthy Swahili Coast city-state, controlling the gold trade from the Zimbabwe Plateau via the port of Sofala. Husuni Kubwa palace (c. 1310-1333) was the largest pre-European stone building in sub-Saharan Africa. Sacked by the Portuguese in 1505. |
| **Key Findings** | Husuni Kubwa palace (over 100 rooms, octagonal swimming pool); Great Mosque (one of the earliest on the coast); imported Chinese porcelain, Indian beads, and glass; copper coins minted locally |
| **Dating Method** | Radiocarbon, ceramic chronology, coin finds, Arabic and Portuguese textual sources |
| **Current Status** | UNESCO World Heritage Site |
| **Key Publication** | Chittick, H.N. *Kilwa: An Islamic Trading City* (1974) |
| **Confidence** | [Established] for major structures and trade role; [Debated] for precise dating of construction phases |

### Shanga

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Location** | Pate Island, Lamu Archipelago, Kenya |
| **Period** | c. 760-1400 CE |
| **Type** | Swahili Coast settlement |
| **Excavated By** | Mark Horton (1980s) |
| **Significance** | One of the most thoroughly excavated early Swahili sites. Provides the clearest archaeological sequence for understanding Swahili urbanism from its earliest phases. Demonstrates that the Swahili Coast was not the product of Arab colonization but of indigenous African development with Indian Ocean trade connections. |
| **Key Findings** | Continuous occupation sequence from timber to stone construction; early mosque (one of the oldest in East Africa); evidence of gradual Islamization alongside indigenous African culture; iron-smelting, bead-making |
| **Dating Method** | Radiocarbon, stratigraphy |

| **Key Publication** | Horton, M. *Shanga: The Archaeology of a Muslim Trading Community* (1996) |
| **Confidence** | [Established] |

### Gedi (Gede)

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Location** | Coast of Kenya, near Malindi |
| **Period** | c. 1100-1600 CE |
| **Type** | Swahili Coast town |
| **Excavated By** | James Kirkman (1948-58); later work by various teams |
| **Significance** | One of the best-preserved Swahili Coast ruins, with standing walls of houses, mosques, and a palace. Provides excellent evidence of daily life in a middle-ranking Swahili town. Abandoned in the 16th or 17th century, possibly due to Portuguese disruption and Oromo raids. |
| **Key Findings** | Well-preserved stone houses with indoor plumbing; Great Mosque; palace; Chinese porcelain; evidence of trade with the Persian Gulf, India, and China |
| **Dating Method** | Radiocarbon, imported ceramics (Chinese porcelain chronology) |

## Southern Africa

### Great Zimbabwe

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Location** | Southeastern Zimbabwe, near Masvingo |
| **Period** | c. 1100-1450 CE (peak c. 1220-1420) |
| **Type** | Stone-walled royal capital and ceremonial center |
| **Excavated By** | Early: Theodore Bent (1891), Randall-MacIver (1905), Gertrude Caton-Thompson (1929); later: Peter Garlake (1960s-70s), Tom Huffman, Edward Matenga |
| **Significance** | The largest and most famous pre-colonial stone structure in sub-Saharan Africa south of the Sahara. The Great Enclosure's outer wall is 250 meters long and up to 11 meters high — built entirely without mortar. Center of a powerful state controlling the gold trade between the Zimbabwe Plateau and the Swahili Coast. Colonial-era authorities infamously denied African authorship; modern archaeology has definitively established it as a Shona-speaking African achievement. |
| **Key Findings** | Great Enclosure; Hill Complex (royal residence); Valley Ruins; soapstone Zimbabwe Birds (national symbol); Chinese ceramics, Indian beads, glass — evidence of Indian Ocean trade; gold-working evidence |
| **Dating Method** | Radiocarbon, ceramic chronology |
| **Current Status** | UNESCO World Heritage Site; national monument of Zimbabwe |
| **Key Publication** | Garlake, P. *Great Zimbabwe* (1973); Pikirayi, I. *The Zimbabwe Culture* (2001); Huffman, T.N. *Snakes and Crocodiles* (1996) |
| **Confidence** | [Established] for African construction and trade connections; [Debated] for precise construction phases, political organization, and population |

**Note on the "Great Zimbabwe Controversy":** Colonial-era scholars and politicians promoted theories attributing Great Zimbabwe to Phoenicians, Arabs, or other non-African builders — a racist fiction thoroughly demolished by professional archaeologists beginning with Randall-MacIver (1905) and Caton-Thompson (1929). The Rhodesian government actively suppressed archaeological findings confirming African authorship. This episode is one of the most egregious examples of colonial distortion of African history.

### Mapungubwe

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Location** | Confluence of the Limpopo and Shashe rivers, northern South Africa |
| **Period** | c. 1075-1220 CE |
| **Type** | Hilltop royal capital and trade center |
| **Excavated By** | University of Pretoria (1933+); recent: Tom Huffman, Sian Tiley-Nel |
| **Significance** | Precursor to Great Zimbabwe and the first society in southern Africa to show clear evidence of class distinction and sacred leadership. The hilltop was reserved for the ruling elite — a spatial expression of social hierarchy that became a hallmark of the Zimbabwe culture. Rich in gold and trade goods from the Indian Ocean coast. |
| **Key Findings** | Gold rhinoceros (iconic artifact); gold scepter; glass beads from the Indian Ocean trade; evidence of social stratification (elite hilltop, commoner valley); cattle enclosures |
| **Dating Method** | Radiocarbon |
| **Current Status** | UNESCO World Heritage Site; South African national heritage site |
| **Key Publication** | Huffman, T.N. *Mapungubwe: Ancient African Civilisation on the Limpopo* (2005) |
| **Confidence** | [Established] |

### Khami

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Location** | Near Bulawayo, Zimbabwe |
| **Period** | c. 1450-1683 |
| **Type** | Stone-walled capital of the Torwa/Rozvi state |
| **Excavated By** | Keith Robinson (1947-55); more recent work |
| **Significance** | Successor to Great Zimbabwe as a major political center on the Zimbabwe Plateau. Different architectural style (decorated stone walls with check patterns) indicates cultural evolution from the Great Zimbabwe tradition. Capital of the state that preceded and was absorbed by the Rozvi/Changamire dynasty. |
| **Key Findings** | Decorated stone walls; imported trade goods (Chinese porcelain, European glass); evidence of gold-working |
| **Dating Method** | Radiocarbon, imported ceramics |
| **Current Status** | UNESCO World Heritage Site |
| **Key Publication** | Robinson, K.R. *Khami Ruins* (1959) |

| **Significance** | Capital of the Aksumite kingdom, one of the great civilizations of the ancient world. Monumental carved stelae (obelisks) up to 33 meters tall. Mint that produced its own coinage (one of the few in the ancient world outside the Mediterranean/Middle East). Conversion to Christianity under Ezana (c. 330). Traditional home of the Ark of the Covenant according to Ethiopian belief. |
| **Key Findings** | Giant stelae (largest surviving: 24 meters); royal tombs; pre-Christian and Christian inscriptions (Ge'ez, Greek, Sabaean); coins; palace foundations; Church of St. Mary of Zion (traditional Ark repository) |
| **Dating Method** | Radiocarbon, coin chronology, inscriptions, architectural analysis |
| **Current Status** | UNESCO World Heritage Site; active pilgrimage site |
| **Key Publication** | Munro-Hay, S. *Aksum: An African Civilisation* (1991); Phillipson, D.W. *Ancient Ethiopia* (1998) |

| **Location** | Lasta region, northern Ethiopia |
| **Period** | c. 1181-1221 CE (construction period; continued use to present) |
| **Type** | Rock-hewn church complex |
| **Excavated By** | Survey and conservation work rather than full excavation. Studies by David Phillipson, Lepage and Mercier, Michael Gervers. |
| **Significance** | Eleven medieval churches carved directly from living rock, connected by tunnels and passages. An extraordinary feat of engineering and artistic achievement, often called the "Eighth Wonder of the World." Attributed to King Lalibela of the Zagwe dynasty, who tradition says was inspired by a divine vision or a visit to Jerusalem. |

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Location** | Coast of Eritrea, near Massawa |
| **Period** | c. 500 BCE - 700 CE |
| **Type** | Port city |
| **Excavated By** | Various, including recent Eritrean-international joint projects |
| **Significance** | The main port of the Aksumite kingdom and a key node in Red Sea and Indian Ocean trade. Through Adulis, Aksum traded with the Roman Empire, Arabia, India, and beyond. Described by the anonymous author of the *Periplus of the Erythraean Sea* (c. 1st century CE). |
| **Key Findings** | Roman, Indian, and Arabian trade goods; monumental architecture; Christian-era remains |
