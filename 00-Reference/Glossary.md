## Usage Notes

### Transliteration
Many terms have multiple English spellings reflecting different transliteration systems. This glossary uses the most common English-language forms as primary entries with variants noted. Example: Djeli/Jeli/Jali all refer to the same role.

### Context Sensitivity
Several terms carry different connotations depending on context. "Ghana" means something different as a medieval title versus a modern country name. "Sudan" in Arabic sources refers to a vast region, not the modern nation-state. Always clarify usage in context.

### Evolving Scholarship
Terminology in African studies evolves as scholars work to decolonize vocabulary. Older sources may use now-rejected terms. This glossary reflects current scholarly consensus where possible.
